### Slide 4

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on the motivations and applications of Laplace and Z transforms, specifically focusing on system/filter design and analysis. The slide is divided into several sections, each addressing a particular aspect of the topic.

**Motivation and Application #1: System/Filter Design and Analysis**

*   The section begins with a diagram illustrating the relationship between an input signal $x(t)$, a system, and an output signal $y(t)$.
*   The diagram shows that the output signal $y(t)$ is equal to the convolution of the input signal $x(t)$ and the impulse response $h(t)$ of the system, denoted as $y(t) = x(t) * h(t)$.
*   The Laplace transform of the impulse response $h(t)$ is represented as $H(s)$, which is also known as the system transfer function.

**System Transfer Function and Frequency Response**

*   The system transfer function $H(s)$ is defined as the Laplace transform of the impulse response $h(t)$, i.e., $\mathcal{L}[h(t)] = H(s)$.
*   If the attention is restricted to $s = j\omega$ or $\sigma = 0$ for $0 < \omega < \infty$, and $H(s)$ is evaluated for $s = j\omega$, it is referred to as the system frequency response $H(j\omega)$.

**Output for a Steady-State Sinusoid**

*   If the input $x(t) = e^{st}$ and $s = j\omega$, the output $y(t)$ can be expressed as $y(t) = H(s)e^{st}$.
*   For $s = j\omega$, the output becomes $y(t) = H(j\omega)e^{j\omega t}$, which represents the output for a steady-state sinusoid.

**Frequency Response and Phase Response**

*   The frequency response $H(j\omega)$ can be expressed in polar form as $H(j\omega) = |H(j\omega)|e^{j<H(j\omega)}$.
*   The output $y(t)$ can be rewritten as $y(t) = |H(j\omega)|e^{j(\omega t + <H(j\omega))}$.
*   The frequency response is composed of two parts: the magnitude response $|H(j\omega)|$ and the phase response $<H(j\omega)$.

**Notes**

*   Three key notes are provided:
    *   The frequency of the output is equal to the frequency of the input.
    *   The output magnitude is equal to the input magnitude times the magnitude response $|H(j\omega)|$.
    *   The output phase is equal to the input phase plus the phase response $<H(j\omega)$.

**S-Plane Diagram**

*   A diagram of the s-plane is provided, showing the imaginary axis labeled as $s = j\omega$ and the real axis labeled as $\sigma$.
*   The diagram illustrates the relationship between the complex frequency $s$ and the frequency $\omega$.

In summary, the lecture slide provides a comprehensive overview of the motivations and applications of Laplace and Z transforms in system/filter design and analysis. It covers the definition of the system transfer function, frequency response, and phase response, as well as their relationships to the input and output signals. The notes section highlights important properties of the output signal, and the s-plane diagram visualizes the complex frequency domain.

### Slide 5

The image presents a detailed lecture slide focused on the frequency response of a system, specifically exploring the relationship between input phase, output phase, and phase response. The slide is divided into sections, each addressing a particular aspect of the system's behavior.

### **Title and Initial Equation**

- The slide begins with the equation: **Output phase = Input phase + phase response <H(jω)**.
- It then introduces an example involving the transfer function **H(s) = 1 / (1 + s)**, with a note that **s = -1 is a pole**.

### **Derivation of H(jω)**

- By substituting **s = jω** into the transfer function, we obtain **H(jω) = 1 / (1 + jω)**.
- The magnitude of **H(jω)** is derived as **|H(jω)| = 1 / √(1 + ω^2)**.
- The phase angle of **H(jω)**, denoted as **<H(jω)**, is calculated using the argument of the complex number **(1 - <(1+jω)) = tan^(-1)(ω/1) - tan^(-1)(ω/1) = -tan^(-1)(ω)**.

### **Key Points and Graphs**

- At specific values of **ω (0, 1, ∞)**, the magnitude and phase angle of **H(jω)** are evaluated:
  - For **ω = 0**, **|H(jω)| = 1** and **<H(jω) = 0**.
  - For **ω = 1**, **|H(jω)| = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7** and **<H(jω) = -π/4**.
  - For **ω = ∞**, **|H(jω)| = 0** and **<H(jω) = -π/2**.
- A graph of **|H(jω)|** versus **ω** shows a decreasing curve starting from 1 and approaching 0 as **ω** increases.
- A graph of **<H(jω)** versus **ω** shows a curve that decreases from 0 to -π/2 as **ω** increases from 0 to ∞.

### **Example: Steady-State Response**

- An example is provided to find the steady-state response of the system to an input **x(t) = sin(10t + π/4)**.
- The steady-state response **y(t)** is expressed as **|H(j10)|sin(10t + π/4 + <H(j10))**, where **|H(j10)|** and **<H(j10))** are evaluated at **ω = 10**.

### **Pole Location and Nyquist Diagram**

- A simple Nyquist diagram or pole plot is sketched, showing the pole location at **s = -1** on the real axis.

### **Conclusion**

The slide comprehensively covers the frequency response analysis of a first-order system, including the derivation of its transfer function in the frequency domain, magnitude and phase response plots, and an example application to find the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. The graphical representations help visualize how the system's magnitude and phase shift change with frequency.

    $\angle H(j10) = -\tan^{-1}(\omega) = -\tan^{-1}(10) = -1.47$

*   The third equation is:

    $y(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{101}} \sin(10t + \frac{\pi}{4} - 1.47)$

H(S) = \frac{a_m s^m + a_{m-1} s^{m-1} + \cdots + a_0}{b_n s^n + b_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \cdots + b_0} = K \frac{(s-\alpha_1)(s-\alpha_2) \cdots (s-\alpha_m)}{(s-\lambda_1)(s-\lambda_2) \cdots (s-\lambda_n)}
$$

* This is followed by the pole-zero form and pole-zero-gain form:

$$
H(j\omega) = K \frac{(j\omega-\alpha_1)(j\omega-\alpha_2) \cdots (j\omega-\alpha_m)}{(j\omega-\lambda_1)(j\omega-\lambda_2) \cdots (j\omega-\lambda_n)} = K \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{m} (j\omega-\alpha_i)}{\prod_{k=1}^{n} (j\omega-\lambda_k)}
$$

**Middle Section: Magnitude and Phase Response**

$$
|H(j\omega)| = K \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{m} |j\omega-\alpha_i|}{\prod_{k=1}^{n} |j\omega-\lambda_k|}
$$

|j\omega-\lambda_k| = \sqrt{\sigma_k^2 + (\omega-\omega_k)^2}
$$

* The phase of $(j\omega-\lambda_k)$ is:

$$
\angle (j\omega-\lambda_k) = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\omega-\omega_k}{-\sigma_k} \right)
$$

**Diagram: S-Plane Representation**

$$
H(s) = \frac{1}{[s - (0.2 + j)][s - (-0.2 - j)]}
$$

* The frequency response $H(j\omega)$ is:

$$
H(j\omega) = \frac{1}{[j\omega - (-0.2 + j)][j\omega - (-0.2 - j)]}
$$

* The magnitude response $|H(j\omega)|$ is:

$$
|H(j\omega)| = \frac{1}{|j\omega - (-0.2 + j)||j\omega - (-0.2 - j)|}
$$

**Bottom Section: Conclusion**

**Tutorial Information**

* Title: Tutorial - Laplace & Z-Transform
* Date: Thursday, October 31, 2024
* Time: 11:15 AM

**Review**

* **Laplace Transform**: 
  * Definition: $\mathcal{L}\{x(t)\} = X(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)e^{-st} dt$
  * Description: 
    + Time-domain input
    + Frequency-domain representation
* **Z-Transform**:
  * Definition: $\mathcal{Z}\{x[n]\} = X[z] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] z^{-n}$
  * Description: Discrete-time

**Example Problems**

### Problem 1: Laplace Transform

* **Problem Statement**: 4.1-1 (a) - Find the Laplace transform, $X(s)$, of $x(t) = u(t) - u(t - 1)$ using direct integration. What is the region of convergence?
* **Solution**:
  * $X(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt = \int_{0}^{1} e^{-st} dt = \left. -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \right|_{t=0}^{t=1} = -\frac{1}{s} [e^{-s} - 1]$
  * $X(s) = \frac{1}{s} (1 - e^{-s})$
* **Region of Convergence**:
  * $X(0)$ is undefined
  * $\Rightarrow$ R.O.C.: $s \neq 0$

* **Solution**:
  * $X(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{t}{e} e^{-st} dt + \int_{1}^{\infty} e^{-t} e^{-st} dt$
  * Integration by parts is noted but not fully expanded.

The image provides a detailed walkthrough of solving Laplace transform problems using direct integration, emphasizing the process and region of convergence for each example.

### Slide 17

The image presents a detailed lecture slide focused on signal processing and transform theory, specifically covering the Laplace transform, region of convergence (ROC), and z-transform. The content is densely packed with mathematical equations, formulas, and a graph.

**Top Section: Laplace Transform and Region of Convergence**

* The top section begins with an integral equation:
  ```
  ∫[1 to ∞] e^(-t(s+1)) dt
  ```
  This is evaluated step-by-step, leading to:
  ```
  = [-1/(s+1)] * (e^(-(∞)(s+1)) - e^(-(1)(s+1))) ... when Re{s+1} > 0
  => Re{s} > -1
  = e^(-(s+1))/(s+1)
  ```
* A key point is noted: "...no assumptions affecting R.O.C."
* The result for \(X(s)\) is given by:
  ```
  X(s) = 1/s * (1/s - e^(-s)/s^2 - e^(-s)/s) + e^(-(s+1))/(s+1)
  ```
* The Region of Convergence (ROC) is defined as \(Re\{s\} > -1\), \(s \neq 0\).

**Graph: Region of Convergence**

* A graph to the right illustrates the ROC, showing:
  + A vertical line at \(Re(s) = -1\).
  + A shaded area to the right of this line, indicating the ROC.
  + The line \(s=0\) is marked with a dashed line and an arrow pointing to it, indicating a pole at \(s=0\).

**Bottom Section: Z-Transform**

* The z-transform section starts with the definition:
  ```
  X[z] = ∑[x[n] * z^(-n)] from n=-∞ to ∞
  ```
  Applied to \(x[n] = (-1)^n * [u(n) - u(n-8)]\), it simplifies to:
  ```
  = ∑[(-1)^n * z^(-n)] from n=0 to 7
  ```
* Recognized as a geometric series with \(r = -1/z\) and \(M=7\):
  ```
  ∑[r^k] from k=0 to M = (1 - r^(M+1))/(1 - r)
  ```
  Substituting \(r\) and \(M\) yields:
  ```
  X[z] = (1 - (-1/z)^8) / (1 - (-1/z)) = (1 - (1/z^8)) / (1 + 1/z)
  ```

**Additional Problem Statement**

* At the bottom, a problem statement for 5.1.4 (b) is partially visible:
  ```
  5.1.4 (b): Find the z-transform of x[n] = (γ)^n sin[πn] u[n]. What is the ROC?
  ```

In summary, this lecture slide covers the evaluation of a Laplace transform and its ROC, followed by the calculation of a z-transform for a given sequence and an introduction to another problem involving the z-transform. The mathematical derivations are detailed, aiming to illustrate key concepts in transform theory.

### Slide 18

## Step 1: Detailed Summary of the Lecture Slide

The lecture slide appears to be discussing the z-transform of a discrete-time signal. The content can be broken down into several sections.

## Step 2: Top Section

The top section of the slide presents a few key points:
- A written equation: $\lambda[n] = \delta \sin(\pi n) u[n] = 0 \: ( \forall ) \: n$
- A graph with $\sin(\pi n)$ on the y-axis and $n$ on the x-axis. The graph shows that $\sin(\pi n) = 0$ for all integer values of $n$ (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are marked on the x-axis with red dots on the x-axis, indicating that the sine function equals zero at these points).
- The z-transform $X[z]=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} 0 \: z^{-n} = 0$ with a Region of Convergence (R.O.C.) of all $z$.

## 3: Main Problem and Solution

The main problem on the slide is:

### 5.1.4 (c): Find the z-transform of $x[n] = (\gamma)^n \cos[\pi n] u[n]$. What is the ROC?

## 4: Derivation of the z-transform

The solution to the problem involves several steps:

- Express $x[n]$ in terms of $(-1)^n$ since $\cos(\pi n) = (-1)^n$.
  - $x[n] = \gamma^n \cos[\pi n] u[n] = \gamma^n (-1)^n u[n] = (-\gamma)^n u[n]$

- A graph showing $(-1)^n$ for $n$ = 0 to 7, with blue vertical lines representing the amplitude at each $n$, alternating between 1 and -1.

- The z-transform $X[z]$ is then derived as:
  - $X[z] = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-\gamma/z)^n z^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-\gamma/z)^n$

## 5: Geometric Series

The sum is recognized as a geometric series:
- $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^k = \frac{1}{1-r}$ for $|r| < 1$

## 6: Applying Geometric Series Formula

Applying this formula:
- $X[z] = \frac{1}{1-(-\gamma/z)} = \frac{1}{1 + \gamma/z} = \frac{z}{z + \gamma}$

## 7: Region of Convergence (ROC)

The condition for convergence is:
- $|-\gamma/z| < 1 \Rightarrow |\gamma| < |z|$

## 8: Conclusion

The z-transform of $x[n] = (\gamma)^n \cos[\pi n] u[n]$ is $\frac{z}{z + \gamma}$ with a Region of Convergence (ROC) of $|\gamma| < |z|$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{|\gamma| < |z|}$
