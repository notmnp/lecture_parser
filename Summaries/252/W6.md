# Convolution & LTI System Cheat Sheet

## 1.  Convolution in Discrete‑Time

- **Convolution sum**
  \[
  y[n] \;=\; (x*h)[n] \;=\; \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[m]\,h[n-m]
  \]
  *Think of sliding one waveform over the other and “summing” the overlap.*

- **Example (step input & exponential impulse)**
  \[
  h[n]=\bigl(\tfrac34\bigr)^n u[n], \qquad
  x[n]=u[n]
  \]
  *Only indices where both are non‑zero contribute: \(m=0,\dots,n\).*

  \[
  y[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{n}\!\bigl(\tfrac34\bigr)^{\,n-m}
        = \bigl(\tfrac34\bigr)^n \sum_{k=0}^{n}\!\bigl(\tfrac43\bigr)^k
        = \bigl(\tfrac34\bigr)^n \frac{(\tfrac43)^{n+1}-1}{\tfrac43-1}
  \]

  The result is a weighted sum of a geometric series.

- **Convolution with an impulse**
  \[
  x[n]*\delta[n] = x[n], \qquad
  x[n]*\delta[n-n_0] = x[n-n_0]
  \]
  *The impulse “copies” the input, shifted by \(n_0\).*

## 2.  Convolution in Continuous‑Time

- **Convolution integral**
  \[
  y(t) = (x*h)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau)\,h(t-\tau)\,d\tau
  \]

- **Step response example**
  \[
  h(t)=u(t),\qquad x(t)=e^{-at}u(t)
  \]
  \[
  y(t)=\int_{0}^{t} e^{-a\tau}\,d\tau
       = \frac{1-e^{-at}}{a}\,u(t)
  \]
  *The output is the area under the decaying exponential, truncated at \(t=0\).*

## 3.  Graphical Convolution Procedure (Both Domains)

1. **Time‑reverse** the impulse response:
   \[
   h[-m] \;\text{(discrete)},\qquad h(-\tau) \;\text{(continuous)}
   \]
2. **Shift** the reversed impulse by \(n\) (discrete) or \(t\) (continuous):
   \[
   h[n-m]\;\text{or}\;h(t-\tau)
   \]
3. **Multiply** point‑wise with the input.
4. **Sum/Integrate** all products to get the output sample.

*Visualization:* Imagine sliding a mirror‑image of the impulse over the input and measuring the overlapped area.

## 4.  Key Convolution Properties

| Property | Discrete | Continuous |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Commutative** | \(x*h = h*x\) | \(x*h = h*x\) |
| **Associative** | \((x*h_1)*h_2 = x*(h_1*h_2)\) | \((x*h_1)*h_2 = x*(h_1*h_2)\) |
| **Distributive** | \(x*(h_1+h_2)=x*h_1+x*h_2\) | Same |
| **Shift** | \(x[n-n_0]*h[n]=x[n]*h[n-n_0]\) | \(x(t-\tau)*h(t)=x(t)*h(t-\tau)\) |
| **Impulse** | \(x*\delta = x\) | \(x*h = x\) when \(h=\delta\) |

*These rules let you simplify convolutions algebraically.*

## 5.  System Properties from Impulse Response \(h(\cdot)\)

| Property | Condition on \(h\) | Intuitive Meaning |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Memoryless** | \(h(t)=C\delta(t)\) (or \(h[n]=C\delta[n]\)) | Output depends only on current input. |
| **Causality** | \(h(t)=0\;\text{for}\;t<0\) (or \(h[n]=0\;\text{for}\;n<0\)) | System never anticipates future input. |
| **Stability (BIBO)** | \(\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|h(t)|dt < \infty\) (DT: \(\sum |h[n]|<\infty\)) | Bounded input → bounded output. |

*If the impulse response has a “tail” that extends infinitely with non‑zero weight, the system is unstable.*

## 6.  Worked Example: Convolution of Two Piecewise Functions

Let
\[
h_1(t) = (1-t)\,[u(t)-u(t-1)],\qquad
h_2(t) = t\,[u(t+2)-u(t-2)] .
\]
These are non‑zero on \([0,1]\) and \([-2,2]\), respectively.

- **Overlap intervals** (from graphical analysis):
  1. \(t\le -2\): no overlap → \(y(t)=0\).
  2. \(-2\le t\le -1\): integrate from \(0\) to \(t+2\).
  3. \(-1\le t\le 2\): integrate from \(0\) to \(1\).
  4. \(2\le t\le 3\): integrate from \(t-2\) to \(1\).
  5. \(t\ge 3\): no overlap → \(y(t)=0\).

- **General integral**:
  \[
  y(t)=\int_{\text{overlap}} (1-\tau)\,(t-\tau)\,d\tau
  \]
  Evaluate the piecewise integrals to obtain a cubic polynomial in each interval.

*The key idea: convolution equals the area of overlap of the two time‑reversed, shifted waveforms.*

> **Tip for Exams**  
> Memorize the **convolution sum/ integral** and the **basic properties**.  
> For a given problem, first determine *when* the two signals overlap; only there does the integral/sum contribute.  
> Then apply the appropriate formula (geometric series for exponentials, direct integration for piecewise linear functions, or the impulse property for delta functions).  

This cheat sheet covers the essentials you’ll need to solve convolution problems and analyze LTI systems in both discrete and continuous time.

## Raw Slide Summaries

### Slide 1

The image presents a detailed, handwritten lecture slide on the topic of "Convolution sum Part 2" in the context of signal processing and Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. The slide is densely filled with mathematical equations, graphs, and explanatory text, indicating a comprehensive explanation of how to find the output of an LTI system described by a specific impulse response $h[n]$ to an input signal $x[n]$. Here's a structured breakdown of the content:

### Title and Date
- **Title:** "Convolution sum Part 2"
- **Date:** "October 7, 2020 11:20 AM"

### Method for LTI System Response to Signals of Long Duration
The slide begins with a method for finding the response of LTI systems to signals of long duration, using the convolution sum. The example provided involves:
- **Impulse Response $h[n]$:** $(\frac{3}{4})^n u[n]$
- **Input Signal $x[n]$:** $u[n]$

### Example: Finding Output of the LTI System
The goal is to find the output $y[n]$ at specific values of $n$, notably $n = -5$ and $n = 5$.

### Convolution Sum Formula
The convolution sum is given by:
\[y[n] = x[n] * h[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[m]h[n-m]\]

### Impulse Response $h[n]$ and Input Signal $x[n]$
- **$h[n] = (\frac{3}{4})^n u[n]$** is a geometric sequence that is zero for $n < 0$ and increases for $n \geq 0$.
- **$x[n] = u[n]$** is a unit step function that is 0 for $n < 0$ and 1 for $n \geq 0$.

### Shifted Impulse Response $h[n-m]$
The expression for $h[n-m]$ is derived as:
\[h[n-m] = (\frac{3}{4})^{n-m} u[n-m] = \begin{cases} (\frac{3}{4})^{n-m} & \text{if } n-m \geq 0 \text{ or } n \geq m \\ 0 & \text{if } n-m < 0 \text{ or } n < m \end{cases}\]

### Calculating $y[n]$
To calculate $y[n]$, we substitute $x[m]$ and $h[n-m]$ into the convolution sum:
\[y[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} u[m] h[n-m]\]

### Specific Calculations for $y[5]$
For $y[5]$:
\[y[5] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} u[m] h[5-m]\]
Given $h[5-m]$ and $u[m]$, the sum simplifies because $u[m] = 0$ for $m < 0$ and $h[5-m] = 0$ for $m > 5$.
\[y[5] = \sum_{m=0}^{5} (\frac{3}{4})^{5-m}\]

### Detailed Calculation for $y[5]$
The calculation involves summing a geometric series:
\[y[5] = (\frac{3}{4})^5 \sum_{m=0}^{5} (\frac{4}{3})^m\]
Using the sum of a geometric series formula:
\[\sum_{m=0}^{n} r^m = \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1}\]
with $r = \frac{4}{3}$ and $n = 5$:
\[y[5] = (\frac{3}{4})^5 \frac{(\frac{4}{3})^6 - 1}{\frac{4}{3} - 1}\]

### Calculation
\[y[5] = (\frac{3}{4})^5 \frac{(\frac{4}{3})^6 - 1}{\frac{1}{3}}\]
\[y[5] = (\frac{3}{4})^5 \cdot 3 \cdot ((\frac{4}{3})^6 - 1)\]
\[y[5] = (\frac{3}{4})^5 \cdot 3 \cdot (\frac{4^6}{3^6} - 1)\]
\[y[5] = (\frac{3}{4})^5 \cdot 3 \cdot (\frac{4096}{729} - 1)\]
\[y[5] = (\frac{243}{1024}) \cdot 3 \cdot (\frac{4096 - 729}{729})\]
\[y[5] = \frac{729}{1024} \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{3367}{729}\]
\[y[5] = \frac{3 \cdot 3367}{1024}\]
\[y[5] = \frac{10101}{1024}\]

### $y[-5]$ Calculation
The slide also mentions calculating $y[-5]$ but does not complete the calculation.

### Graphs
The slide includes several graphs illustrating $h[n]$, $x[n]$, $h[n-m]$, and $u[m]$. These graphs help visualize the signals and their transformations during the convolution process.

### Conclusion
The slide provides a detailed example of applying the convolution sum to find the output of an LTI system with a given impulse response to a unit step input. It demonstrates how to calculate the output at specific times, $n = 5$ and $n = -5$, with a focus on the mathematical steps involved in the convolution process.

        *   A graphical procedure:
            1.  Time reverse $h[m]: h[-m]$
*   **Graphical Procedure**
    *   The graphical procedure involves several steps, including:
        *   Time reversing $h[m]$ to obtain $h[-m]$
        *   Sliding $h[-m]$ over the input signal $x[n]$
        *   Computing the product of $x[n]$ and $h[n-m]$ at each position

### Slide 4

The image presents a detailed lecture slide focused on signal processing, specifically discussing the convolution operation. The slide is divided into two main sections: a list of steps and an example with accompanying graphs.

**Steps:**

*   **Step 1:** Time reverse $h[m]$: $h[-m]$
*   **Step 2:** Shift $h[-m]$, $n$ units: $h[-(m-n)]=h[n-m]$
    *   Shift to right if $n>0$
    *   Shift to left if $n<0$
*   **Step 3:** For shifts of $n$ units in the $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ range:
    *   Multiply $x[m]$ and $h[n-m]$ sample by sample
    *   Add all products to obtain $y[n]$

**Example:**

The example provided illustrates the convolution operation between two signals, $x[n]$ and $h[n]$, denoted as $y[n]=x[n]*h[n]=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[m]h[n-m]$. The example is visualized through a series of graphs, showcasing the following:

*   **Signal $x[n]$:** A discrete-time signal represented by a red graph
*   **Signal $h[n]$:** A discrete-time signal represented by a green graph
*   **Time-Reversed Signal $h[-m]$:** The time-reversed version of $h[m]$, used in the convolution process
*   **Shifted Signals $h[n-m]$:** The signal $h[-m]$ shifted by $n$ units, where $n$ takes on different values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
*   **Convolution Result $y[n]$:** The resulting signal obtained by convolving $x[n]$ and $h[n]$, represented by a blue graph

The graphs are plotted on a grid paper background, with axes labeled and arrows indicating the direction of shifts. The example demonstrates how the convolution operation is performed step-by-step, providing a clear understanding of the process. Overall, the slide provides a comprehensive explanation of the convolution operation, making it easier for students to grasp this fundamental concept in signal processing.

### Slide 5

The image presents a comprehensive lecture slide on the topic of "From convolution sum to convolution integral." The slide is divided into two main sections, with the left side focusing on discrete-time (D.T.) systems and the right side on continuous-time (C.T.) systems.

**Discrete-Time (D.T.) Systems:**

*   The section begins with the definition of a discrete-time signal:
    *   $x[n]=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[m] \delta[n-m]$
*   It then introduces the concept of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system, which satisfies the properties of:
    *   Time invariance: $\delta[n-m] \xrightarrow{LTI} h[n-m]$
    *   Linearity: $x[m] \delta[n-m] \xrightarrow{LTI} x[m] h[n-m]$
*   The convolution sum is derived as:
    *   $y[n] = x[n] * h[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[m] h[n-m]$

**Continuous-Time (C.T.) Systems:**

*   The section starts with the definition of a continuous-time signal:
    *   $x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) \delta(t-\tau) d\tau$
*   It highlights the sampling or sifting property of the Dirac delta function:
    *   $x(t) \xrightarrow{LTI} y(t)$
    *   $\delta(t) \xrightarrow{LTI} h(t)$
    *   $\delta(t-\tau) \xrightarrow{LTI} h(t-\tau)$
*   The linearity and superposition properties are presented as:
    *   $x(\tau) \delta(t-\tau) \xrightarrow{LTI} x(\tau) h(t-\tau)$
    *   $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) \delta(t-\tau) d\tau \xrightarrow{LTI} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d\tau$
*   The convolution integral is defined as:
    *   $y(t) = h(t) * x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d\tau$

**Example:**

*   The slide provides an example of finding the unit impulse response of an LTI system with $h(t) = u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is the unit step function.
*   The input signal is given as $x(t) = e^{-at} u(t)$, and the goal is to find the output $y(t)$.
*   The convolution integral is evaluated as:
    *   $y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d\tau = \int_{0}^{t} e^{-a\tau} d\tau = \frac{1-e^{-at}}{a} u(t)$

**Graphical Method:**

*   The slide illustrates the graphical method for evaluating the convolution integral.
*   It shows the plots of $x(\tau)$, $h(t-\tau)$, and the resulting output $y(t)$.

In summary, the lecture slide provides a detailed overview of the transition from convolution sum to convolution integral, covering both discrete-time and continuous-time systems. It derives the convolution sum and integral, discusses their properties, and presents an example application. The graphical method for evaluating the convolution integral is also illustrated.

### Slide 6

*   The graphs are labeled as $h(t-\xi)$ for $t=0$, $h(t-\xi)$ for $t=t_1>0$, and $h(t-\xi)$ for $t_2>t_1>0$.
*   Each graph features:
    *   A black curve representing $q(\xi)$
    *   A red curve representing $h(t-\xi)$
    *   A vertical axis labeled $\xi$
    *   A horizontal axis labeled $t$
*   The graphs illustrate the relationship between $h(t-\xi)$ and $q(\xi)$ at different values of $t$.

**Right Section: Single Graph**

*   The graph is titled with an expression involving $1/a$.
*   The graph features:
    *   A black curve representing an unspecified function
    *   A red dashed curve representing another unspecified function
    *   Two vertical lines labeled $t_1$ and $t_2$
    *   A horizontal axis labeled $\xi$
    *   A vertical axis with no label

**Key Observations**

*   The graphs appear to be hand-drawn on a grid paper background.
*   The use of different colors (black and red) helps to distinguish between the various curves and labels.
*   The image provides a detailed visual representation of the graphical method, allowing for a clear understanding of the relationships between the functions and variables involved.

**Conclusion**

	+ C.T.: $x(t) * h(t) = h(t) * x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau)h(t-\tau)d\tau = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t-\tau)h(\tau)d\tau$

• **Distributive Property**
	+ D.T.: $x[n] * (h_1[n] + h_2[n]) = x[n] * h_1[n] + x[n] * h_2[n]$

### Slide 8

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on deducing system properties from impulse response, covering memory, causality, and system stability (BIBO). The content is organized into three main sections.

**Section 1: Memory**

* A system **has memory** if:
	+ $h(t) \neq 0$ for some $t \neq 0$
	+ $h[n] \neq 0$ for some $n \neq 0$
* A system is **memoryless** if:
	+ $h(t) = C \delta(t)$
	+ $h[n] = C \delta[n]$
	+ where $C$ is a constant

**Section 2: Causality**

* A system is **causal** if:
	+ $h(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$
	+ $h[n] = 0$ for $n < 0$
* Four graphs illustrate different scenarios:
	+ A memoryless and causal system with $h(t)$ on the y-axis and $t$ on the x-axis
	+ A system with memory and non-causal with $h(t)$ on the y-axis and $t$ on the x-axis
	+ A system with memory and non-causal with $h[n]$ on the y-axis and $n$ on the x-axis
	+ A system with memory and causal with $h[n]$ on the y-axis and $n$ on the x-axis

**Section 3: System Stability (BIBO)**

* C.T. (Continuous Time) stability conditions:
	+ $|x(t)| \leq M_x < \infty$
	+ BIBO stable $\Rightarrow |y(t)| \leq M_y < \infty$
* $0 < M_x < \infty$ and $0 < M_y < \infty$
* $y(t) = x(t) * h(t)$
* $|y(t)| = \left| \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\tau) x(t - \tau) d\tau \right| \leq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |h(\tau)| |x(t - \tau)| d\tau$
* $|y(t)| \leq M_x \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |h(\tau)| d\tau$
* So $y(t)$ is bounded if $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |h(\tau)| d\tau$ bounded
* For D.T. (Discrete Time) stability conditions:
	+ $|y[n]| < M_y < \infty$ if $\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} |h[n]| < \infty$
* Five graphs illustrate different stability scenarios:
	+ BIBO stable with $h(t)$ on the y-axis and $t$ on the x-axis
	+ BIBO unstable with $h(t)$ on the y-axis and $t$ on the x-axis
	+ BIBO unstable with $h(t)$ on the y-axis and $t$ on the x-axis
	+ BIBO unstable with $h(t)$ on the y-axis and $t$ on the x-axis

### Slide 9

* The date and time "October 9, 2025 12:06 PM" are shown below the title.
* The text "P 2.4.33c 3rd edition" is written in red ink.
* The following equations are presented:
	+ $h_s(t) = h_1(t) * h_2(t)$
	+ $h_1(t) = (1-t)[u(t)-u(t-1)]$
	+ $h_2(t) = t[u(t+2)-u(t-2)]$
	+ $h_s(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (1-\tau)[u(\tau)-u(\tau-1)](t-\tau)[u(t-\tau+2)-u(t-\tau-2)] d\tau$

**Bottom Section: Graphs and Diagrams**

* The bottom section features six graphs and diagrams, each with its own set of axes, labels, and curves.
* The graphs appear to be hand-drawn and illustrate various functions, including:
	+ $x_1(t) = t$
	+ $x_2(t) = t+1$
	+ $x_3(t) = -t+1$
	+ $h_1(t) = x_3(t)[u(t)-u(t-1)]$
	+ $h_2(t)$
	+ $h_1(\tau)$ and $h_2(t-\tau)$

**Additional Notes and Labels**

* Throughout the slide, there are various notes and labels written in black and red ink, including:
	+ "change $t$ to $t+1$"
	+ "change $t$ to $-t$"
	+ "Week 6 Page 1"

Overall, the slide provides a detailed example of convolution, including mathematical equations and graphical representations. The use of different colors and handwriting suggests that the slide was created during a lecture or presentation.

### Slide 10

The image presents a detailed mathematical explanation of the convolution integral, specifically focusing on the function \(h_s(t)\) and its behavior over different intervals of \(t\). The content is organized into sections, each addressing a specific range of \(t\) values and the corresponding \(h_s(t)\) expressions.

### Overview of the Slide

- **Background**: The slide has a graph paper background, suggesting a detailed and precise mathematical analysis.
- **Content**: It includes handwritten notes and diagrams explaining the convolution of two functions, \(h_1(\tau)\) and \(h_2(t-\tau)\), leading to \(h_s(t)\).

### Mathematical Expressions and Diagrams

1. **For \(t \leq -2\)**:
   - There is no overlap between \(h_1(\tau)\) and \(h_2(t-\tau)\).
   - \(h_s(t) = 0\).

2. **For \(-2 \leq t \leq -1\)**:
   - The integral limits are from \(0\) to \(t+2\).
   - \(h_s(t) = \int_{0}^{t+2} (1-\tau)(t-\tau) d\tau\).
   - A diagram shows \(h_1(\tau)\) and \(h_2(t-\tau)\) with a green shaded area representing the overlap.

3. **For \(-1 \leq t \leq 2\)**:
   - The integral limits are from \(0\) to \(1\).
   - \(h_s(t) = \int_{0}^{1} (1-\tau)(t-\tau) d\tau\).
   - A diagram illustrates the overlap with a green shaded area.

4. **For \(2 \leq t \leq 3\)**:
   - The integral limits are from \(t-2\) to \(1\).
   - \(h_s(t) = \int_{t-2}^{1} (1-\tau)(t-\tau) d\tau\).
   - A diagram shows the overlap area.

### Diagrams

Each section includes a diagram with:
- The \(\tau\) axis and \(t\) axis.
- Plots of \(h_1(\tau)\) and \(h_2(t-\tau)\).
- Shaded green areas indicating the overlap used in the convolution integral.
- Arrows and labels for clarity.

### Conclusion

The slide provides a step-by-step analysis of \(h_s(t)\) over different intervals of \(t\), using integrals and graphical representations to illustrate how the convolution of \(h_1(\tau)\) and \(h_2(t-\tau)\) yields \(h_s(t)\). This detailed approach helps in understanding the behavior of \(h_s(t)\) as \(t\) varies.

### Slide 11

The image presents a detailed, handwritten lecture slide on graph paper, focusing on mathematical equations and their explanations. The content is organized into several key points and equations:

**Equations and Explanations:**

*   **Initial Equation:**
    *   $n_s(t) = \int_{t-2}^{1} (1-z)(t-z)dz$ for $t > 3$
*   **Condition for $t \geq 3$:**
    *   $h_s(t) = 0$ because of no overlap.
*   **Example Calculation:**
    *   $h_s(t) = \int_{t-2}^{1} (1-z)(t-z)dz$ for $2 < t < 3$
    *   $= \int_{t-2}^{1} (t-z-tz+z^2)dz [u(t-2)-u(t-3)]$

**Key Observations:**

*   The slide discusses a specific mathematical problem involving integrals and conditions based on the value of $t$.
*   It highlights that for $t \geq 3$, $h_s(t) = 0$ due to no overlap, indicating a condition where the function $h_s(t)$ becomes zero beyond a certain threshold of $t$.
*   An example calculation is provided for $2 < t < 3$, showing the integration process and the application of a unit step function $[u(t-2)-u(t-3)]$.

**Visual Content:**

*   The background of the slide features graph paper with a light blue grid, providing a structured layout for the handwritten notes.
*   The text and equations are written in black ink, with no diagrams or images present on the slide.

**Footer Information:**

*   At the bottom of the page, it is noted as "Week 6 Page 3," indicating that this slide is part of a series of lectures or notes from Week 6 of a course.
