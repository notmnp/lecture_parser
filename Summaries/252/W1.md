# Complex Numbers Cheat Sheet

## Basics

- **Complex number**  
  $$z = a + jb,$$  
  where $a = \Re\{z\}$ (real part), $b = \Im\{z\}$ (imaginary part).  
  Think of $a$ as horizontal, $b$ as vertical on a plane.

- **Polar form**  
  $$z = r(\cos\theta + j\sin\theta) = re^{j\theta},$$  
  with  
  $$r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} \quad (\text{distance from origin})$$  
  $$\theta = \arg z = \tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \quad (\text{clockwise angle})$$

## Key Identities

- **Euler’s Formula**  
  $$e^{jx} = \cos x + j\sin x.$$

- **Euler’s Identity** (special case)  
  $$e^{j\pi} = -1.$$

- **Conjugate**  
  $$z^* = a - jb = re^{-j\theta}.$$  
  Flip the sign of the imaginary part.

- **Magnitude of product**  
  $$|z_1z_2| = |z_1|\,|z_2|.$$

- **Argument of product**  
  $$\arg(z_1z_2) = \arg z_1 + \arg z_2.$$

- **Magnitude of quotient**  
  $$\left|\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right| = \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}.$$

- **Argument of quotient**  
  $$\arg\!\left(\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right) = \arg z_1 - \arg z_2.$$

- **Product with conjugate**  
  $$zz^* = |z|^2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad |z| = \sqrt{zz^*}.$$

## Addition / Subtraction (Cartesian)

- Sum:  
  $$z_1 + z_2 = (a_1+a_2) + j(b_1+b_2).$$

- Difference:  
  $$z_1 - z_2 = (a_1-a_2) + j(b_1-b_2).$$

- Extract real/imag parts using conjugate:  
  $$\Re\{z\} = \frac{z+z^*}{2}, \qquad \Im\{z\} = \frac{z-z^*}{2j}.$$

## Multiplication / Division (Polar)

| Operation | Formula |
|-----------|---------|
| Multiply | $$z_1z_2 = |z_1||z_2|e^{j(\theta_1+\theta_2)}$$ |
| Divide   | $$\dfrac{z_1}{z_2} = \dfrac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}e^{j(\theta_1-\theta_2)}$$ |

*Think of magnitudes multiplying/dividing like lengths, and angles adding/subtracting like rotating vectors.*

## Quick Conversion

| Cartesian | Polar |
|-----------|-------|
| $r = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ | $\theta = \tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$ |
| $a = r\cos\theta$ | $b = r\sin\theta$ |
| $z = a + jb$ | $z = re^{j\theta}$ |

## Common Examples

- **Unit circle points**  
  $$e^{j0}=1,\quad e^{j\pi/2}=j,\quad e^{j\pi}=-1,\quad e^{3j\pi/2}=-j.$$

- **Magnitude check**  
  $$|5e^{j2.5}| = 5,\qquad |(-3+4j)| = 5.$$

- **Conjugate property**  
  $$(-3+4j)^* = -3-4j,\qquad |(-3+4j)(-3-4j)|=25.$$

**Remember:**  
- The *complex plane* is just a 2‑D coordinate system where the horizontal axis is the real part and the vertical axis is the imaginary part.  
- **Polar representation** turns multiplication into simple scaling (magnitudes) and rotation (angles).  
- The *conjugate* flips the sign of the imaginary part, making it a mirror image across the real axis.  

Use these formulas as a quick reference for manipulating complex numbers in signal processing, control, and communications.

### Slide 2

The image presents a comprehensive mathematical lecture slide focused on converting between Cartesian and polar forms, Euler's formula, and related concepts. The content is densely packed with equations, formulas, definitions, bullet points, and diagrams.

**Converting Cartesian to Polar**

*   The relationship between Cartesian coordinates $(a, b)$ and polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ is given by:
    *   $r^2 = a^2 + b^2 \Rightarrow r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = |z|$
    *   $\theta = \tan^{-1}(b/a) = \angle z$
*   A polar form expression of $z$ is:
    *   $z = a + jb$
    *   $\sin(\theta) = b/r \Rightarrow b = r \sin(\theta)$
    *   $\cos(\theta) = a/r \Rightarrow a = r \cos(\theta)$
    *   $z = r \cos(\theta) + jr \sin(\theta) = r(\cos(\theta) + j \sin(\theta))$

**Euler's Formula**

*   Euler's formula is stated as:
    *   $e^{jx} = \cos(x) + j \sin(x)$
*   The polar form of $z$ using Euler's formula is:
    *   $z = re^{j\theta} = |z|e^{j\angle z}$

**Some Useful Identities**

*   Euler's Identity:
    *   $e^{j\pi} = -1$
*   Example:
    *   $z_0 = r_0 e^{j\theta_0} = 1 e^{j\pi} = e^{j\pi} = -1$
*   Another example:
    *   $1e^{j(\pi/2)} = j1$

**General Rule**

*   For any $\theta$, the general rule for $1e^{j\theta}$ is:
    *   $e^{j\theta}$ is a vector pointing to some position on the unit circle.

**Mathematical Operations**

*   Complex Conjugate:
    *   For $z = a + jb = re^{j\theta}$, the conjugate $z^* = a - jb = re^{-j\theta}$
    *   The operation to obtain the conjugate is to change the sign of all occurrences of $j$.

**Diagrams**

*   Two diagrams are present:
    *   The first diagram shows the unit circle in the complex plane with points labeled at $-1$, $1$, and $\pi$.
    *   The second diagram illustrates the unit circle with a point at $\pi/2$ and an arrow indicating the direction.

Overall, the slide provides a detailed overview of converting between Cartesian and polar forms, Euler's formula, and related mathematical operations, along with illustrative diagrams to support the concepts.

### Slide 3

The image presents a comprehensive collection of mathematical equations and formulas related to complex numbers, covering various operations and properties. The content is organized into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of complex number manipulation.

**Section 1: Addition and Subtraction of Complex Numbers**

*   $z + z^* = a + jb + a - jb = 2a = 2Re\{z\}$
*   $Re\{z\} = \frac{z+z^*}{2}$
*   $z - z^* = a + jb - (a - jb) = a + jb - a + jb = 2jb$
*   $z - z^* = 2jIm\{z\}$
*   $Im\{z\} = \frac{z-z^*}{2j}$

**Section 2: Product of Complex Numbers**

*   $z_1 = a_1 + jb_1$, $z_2 = a_2 + jb_2$
*   $z_3 = z_1z_2 = (a_1 + jb_1)(a_2 + jb_2)$ (Adding more terms, not easy!)
*   $= |z_1|e^{j\angle z_1} |z_2|e^{j\angle z_2} = |z_1||z_2|e^{j(\angle z_1 + \angle z_2)}$
*   $z_3 = |z_1||z_2|e^{j(\angle z_1 + \angle z_2)} = |z_3|e^{j\angle z_3}$
*   $|z_3| = |z_1||z_2|$ (Magnitude of product equals product of individual magnitudes)
*   $\angle z_3 = \angle z_1 + \angle z_2$ (Phase of product equals sum of phases)

**Section 3: Division**

*   $z_4 = \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{a_1 + jb_1}{a_2 + jb_2} = \frac{|z_1|e^{j\angle z_1}}{|z_2|e^{j\angle z_2}} = \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}e^{j(\angle z_1 - \angle z_2)}$
*   $= \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}e^{j(\angle z_1 - \angle z_2)}$

**Section 4: Product of Complex Number and its Conjugate**

*   $zz^* = |z|^2 \Rightarrow |z| = \sqrt{zz^*}$
*   Proof: $zz^* = |z|e^{j\angle z} \cdot |z|e^{-j\angle z} = |z||z|e^{j(\angle z - \angle z)}$
*   $= |z|^2$

In summary, the image provides a detailed overview of complex number operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the product of a complex number with its conjugate. These equations and formulas are fundamental in understanding and working with complex numbers in mathematics and engineering applications.

### Slide 4

The slide contains the following equations:

*   $z = |z| e^{j\varphi} = |z|e^{j\varphi} e^{-j\varphi} e^{j\varphi} = |z|e^{j\varphi} e^{j(\varphi - \varphi)}$
*   $= |z||z|e^{j\varphi} e^{-j\varphi} = |z||z|e^{j(\varphi - \varphi)}$
*   $= |z|^2 e^{j(\varphi - \varphi)}$

There are no diagrams, images, or bullet points on the slide. The text at the bottom of the slide reads:
