## 1. Complex Exponentials  

- **Continuous‑time signal**  
  $$e^{st}=e^{(\sigma+j\omega)t}=e^{\sigma t}\,e^{j\omega t}
     = e^{\sigma t}\bigl(\cos\omega t+j\sin\omega t\bigr)$$
  - *σ* = damping (real part)  
  - *ω* = angular frequency (imaginary part)  

- **Real part (physical sinusoid)**  
  $$\Re\!\bigl(e^{st}\bigr)=e^{\sigma t}\cos\omega t$$  
  *If* σ>0 → exponential growth (unstable)  
  *If* σ<0 → exponential decay (stable)  
  *If* σ=0 → pure sinusoid  

- **Euler’s Formula**  
  $$e^{j\omega}= \cos\omega + j\sin\omega,\qquad |e^{j\omega}|=1$$  
  *Analogy:* a point moving around the unit circle at speed ω.

## 2. Frequency Planes  

| Plane | Variable | Axis Interpretation |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **s‑plane (CT)** | $s=\sigma+j\omega$ | Re = damping (σ), Im = frequency (ω) |
| **γ‑plane (DT)** | $\gamma = e^{s}=e^{\sigma}e^{j\omega}$ | |γ| = $e^{\sigma}$, angle = ω |

- **Mapping**  
  - $σ=0 \;\Rightarrow\; |\gamma|=1$ → unit circle  
  - $σ<0 \;\Rightarrow\; |\gamma|<1$ → inside unit circle (decay)  
  - $σ>0 \;\Rightarrow\; |\gamma|>1$ → outside unit circle (growth)

- **Left vs Right Half‑Plane**  
  - LHP (σ<0): decaying exponentials  
  - RHP (σ>0): growing exponentials

---

## 3. Discrete‑Time Exponentials  

- General form: $$r^{\,n}$$  

| r | Behavior (n → ∞) | Example |
|---|-------------------|---------|
| 0<|r|<1 | decays | $0.8^n$, $0.5^n$ |
| r<0 (|r|<1) | decays with alternating sign | $(-0.8)^n$ |
| |r|>1 | grows | $1.1^n$ |
| r=1 | constant | $1^n = 1$ |

- *Graphical note*:  
  - Positive r → monotonically down/up.  
  - Negative r → oscillating while decaying/growing.

---

## 4. Time‑Invariant vs. Time‑Varying  

**Definition (TI):**  
If an input $x(t)$ produces output $y(t)$, then a delayed input $x(t-T)$ produces a delayed output $y(t-T)$ for *any* $T$.

- **Test** (DT):  
  1. Compute $y_1[n]$ for input $x_1[n]$.  
  2. Delay input: $x_2[n]=x_1[n-m]$.  
  3. Compute $y_2[n]$.  
  4. Check if $y_2[n] = y_1[n-m]$.  

- **Example (DT):** $y[n]=n\,x[n]$  
  - $y_1[n]=n\,x_1[n]$  
  - $y_2[n]=n\,x_1[n-m]$  
  - $y_1[n-m]=(n-m)\,x_1[n-m]$  
  → $y_2[n] \neq y_1[n-m]$ → **time‑varying**.

- **Example (CT):** $y(t)=x(2t)$  
  - Delay input $x_2(t)=x_1(t-T)$  
  - $y_2(t)=x_1(2t-T)$  
  - $y_1(t-T)=x_1(2(t-T))=x_1(2t-2T)$  
  → Not equal → **time‑varying**.

---

## 5. Memoryless vs. Systems With Memory  

- **Memoryless:** Output depends only on *current* input.  
  $$y(t)=f\bigl(x(t)\bigr)\quad\text{or}\quad y[n]=f\bigl(x[n]\bigr)$$

- **With Memory:** Output depends on past (or future) input.  
  - **Finite memory:** Depends on a finite past window.  
  - **Infinite memory:** Depends on all past inputs.

- **Examples**  
  - *Memoryless:* $y(t)=(t-1)x(t)$  
  - *Finite memory:* $y(t)=(t-1)x(t)+x(t-3)$ (depends on $t$ and $t-3$)  
  - *Infinite memory:*  
    $$y[n] = y[n-1] + x[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{n} x[k]$$  
    (Accumulator, stores sum of all past samples)

---

## 6. Quick Reference – System Types  

| Category | Continuous‑Time (CT) | Discrete‑Time (DT) |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Signal Nature** | Analog | Digital |
| **Time Domain** | $t \in \mathbb{R}$ | $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ |
| **Key Test** | Shift input → shift output | Same, but with integer shift |
| **Memory** | Depends on past real‑time interval | Depends on past sample indices |
| **Typical Example** | $y(t)=\int_0^t x(\tau)d\tau$ | $y[n]=\sum_{k=0}^n x[k]$ |

### 📌 Remember

- **Complex exponentials** combine *decay/growth* and *oscillation*.  
- **s‑plane** gives a quick visual: left side stable, right side unstable.  
- **γ‑plane** (DT) is the exponential map of the s‑plane.  
- **Time invariance** is all about *shifting the input* and seeing the same shift in the output.  
- **Memoryless** systems are the simplest: output = function of current input only.

Use this sheet to spot the essential equations, test properties, and recall canonical examples during exams. Happy studying!

### Slide 2

The image presents a comprehensive lecture slide focused on complex frequencies, specifically addressing sinusoids of complex frequency $\sigma + j\omega$. The content is organized into several key sections, each delving into various aspects of complex exponentials and their representations.

### **Complex Exponential for Continuous Time (C.T.) and Discrete Time (D.T.)**

The slide begins by introducing the complex exponential for both continuous time (C.T.) and discrete time (D.T.):

- For C.T., $e^{st}$ is used, where $\gamma = e^s$ or $s = \ln \gamma$.
- For D.T., $e^{sn}$ is used, which translates to $\gamma^n$.

It then explores the relationship between $\gamma$ and $s$, where $\gamma = e^s = e^{\sigma + j\omega} = e^\sigma e^{j\omega}$. The magnitude of $\gamma$ is given by $|\gamma| = |e^\sigma||e^{j\omega}| = |e^\sigma|$.

### **Euler's Formula and Its Implications**

Euler's formula is introduced as $e^{j\omega} = \cos \omega + j\sin \omega$, with its magnitude $|e^{j\omega}| = \sqrt{\cos^2 \omega + \sin^2 \omega} = 1$. This implies that:

- If $\sigma = 0$, then $|\gamma| = 1$, which corresponds to the unit circle.
- If $\sigma < 0$, then $|\gamma| = |e^\sigma| < 1$.
- If $\sigma > 0$, then $|\gamma| = |e^\sigma| > 1$.

### **Complex Frequency Plane**

The slide includes a detailed explanation of the complex frequency plane, also known as the $s$-plane for continuous time and the $\gamma$-plane for discrete time. The $s$-plane is divided into regions based on the real part $\sigma$:

- The left half-plane (LHP) corresponds to $\sigma < 0$, where signals are exponentially decreasing.
- The right half-plane (RHP) corresponds to $\sigma > 0$, where signals are exponentially increasing.

### **Mapping Between $\lambda$-Plane, $\gamma$-Plane, and $s$-Plane**

Two diagrams illustrate the mapping between the $\lambda$-plane, $\gamma$-plane, and $s$-plane. These diagrams show how different regions in one plane correspond to regions in another, highlighting the transformation of exponentially increasing and decreasing signals.

### **Examples of Sequences**

At the bottom of the slide, two graphs depict sequences:

- One sequence is $(0.8)^n$, which represents an exponentially decreasing sequence.
- The other sequence is $(-0.8)^n$, showing oscillatory behavior with exponentially decreasing magnitude.

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, this lecture slide provides a thorough exploration of complex frequencies, covering the mathematical foundations, graphical representations, and implications for signal behavior in both continuous and discrete time systems. It lays the groundwork for understanding the properties of signals and systems in the context of complex analysis.

**Graphs:**

The slide contains four graphs, labeled (a) to (d), arranged in two rows of two columns. Each graph displays a discrete-time exponential function.

*   **Graph (a):** The graph shows a discrete-time exponential function with $r = 0.8$. The x-axis represents $n$, ranging from 0 to 8, while the y-axis represents the amplitude, ranging from 0 to 1. The graph features a series of vertical lines with dots at the top, indicating the amplitude at each value of $n$. The curve $(0.8)^n$ is also plotted, showing a decreasing exponential function.

### Slide 5

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on the classification of systems, specifically focusing on Part 1. The slide is divided into several sections, each addressing a distinct aspect of system classification.

**Learning Outcome**
The learning outcome for this section is clearly stated at the top: "By the end of this section, you should be able to analyze systems in order to classify them."

**System Representation**
A diagram illustrates a system with multiple inputs and outputs:

- Inputs: $x_1(t)$, $x_2(t)$, $x_3(t)$
- Outputs: $y_1(t)$, $y_2(t)$
- Independent variable: time
- Input signals
- Output signals

**Classification #1: C.T. and D.T. Systems**

**Classification #2: Analog and Digital Systems**
This section further categorizes systems based on the nature of their signals:

- Analog systems have analog input and output signals.
- Digital systems have digital input and output signals.

**Classification #3: Time Invariant and Time Varying Systems**
A detailed explanation is provided for time-invariant systems (or constant parameter systems), which are defined as systems with constant parameters with respect to time. The key characteristic of a time-invariant system is that if the input is delayed by $T$ seconds, the output is also delayed by $T$ seconds.

- Bullet points:
  - Examples of time-invariant and time-varying systems.
- Diagrams:
  - A block diagram representing a system with inputs and outputs.
  - Graphical illustrations of input and output signals over time for time-invariant and time-varying systems.

**Axes, Shapes, Arrows, Labels, Curves, Intersections**

Overall, the slide provides a comprehensive overview of system classification, covering continuous-time and discrete-time systems, analog and digital systems, and time-invariant and time-varying systems, along with illustrative examples and graphical representations.

### Slide 6

The image presents a detailed lecture slide focused on time-invariant systems, comprising handwritten notes and equations on a graph paper background. The content is divided into two main sections: one addressing discrete-time (D.T.) systems and the other continuous-time systems.

**Discrete-Time (D.T.) System Section:**

*   **Definition of Time-Invariant System:** 
    *   The top part of the slide illustrates a time-invariant system with the property that a delay in the input results in an equal delay in the output.
    *   Mathematically represented as: $y(t) \rightarrow y(t-T)$ for a delay by $T$.
*   **Example 1:** 
    *   The system is defined as $y[n] = n \cdot x[n]$.
    *   Two inputs are given: $x_1[n]$ with response $y_1[n] = n \cdot x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$ with response $y_2[n] = n \cdot x_2[n]$.
    *   $x_2[n]$ is defined as $x_1[n]$ delayed by $m$ units: $x_2[n] = x_1[n-m]$.
    *   The response to $x_2[n]$ is calculated as $y_2[n] = n \cdot x_1[n-m]$.
    *   A block diagram shows the process of delaying $x_1[n]$ by $m$ and then applying it to the system, resulting in $y_1[n-m] = (n-m) \cdot x_1[n-m]$.
    *   The conclusion drawn is that $y_1[n-m] \neq y_2[n]$, indicating the system is time-varying.

**Continuous-Time System Section:**

*   **Example 2:** 
    *   The system is defined as $y(t) = x(2t)$.
    *   For $x_1(t)$, the response is $y_1(t) = x_1(2t)$.
    *   For $x_2(t)$, the response is $y_2(t) = x_2(2t)$.
    *   Let $x_2(t) = x_1(t-T)$.
    *   Using the system definition, $y_2(t) = x_1(2t-T)$.
    *   Delaying $y_1(t)$ by $T$ yields $y_1(t-T) = x_1(2(t-T)) = x_1(2t-2T)$.
    *   The conclusion is that $y_1(t-T) \neq y_2(t)$, indicating this system is also time-varying.

In summary, the lecture slide provides detailed examples and mathematical derivations to illustrate the concept of time invariance in both discrete-time and continuous-time systems. Through these examples, it demonstrates how to determine if a system is time-invariant or time-varying based on its response to delayed inputs.

### Slide 7

The image presents a comprehensive lecture slide on signal processing, focusing on the classification of systems as memoryless or with memory. The slide is divided into two main sections: a graphical section and a textual section.

**Graphical Section:**

*   The top-left corner features a graph illustrating the relationship between input and output signals for a system.
    *   The graph shows the input signal $x_1(t)$, which is a square wave with an amplitude of 1 and a duration of 2 units, from $t=-2$ to $t=0$.
    *   The output signal $y_1(t) = x_1(2t)$ is also depicted, which is a square wave with an amplitude of 1 and a duration of 1 unit, from $t=-1$ to $t=0$.
    *   The graph also shows the delayed input signal $x_1(t-2)$ and the corresponding output signal $y_2(t)$, which is a square wave with an amplitude of 1 and a duration of 1 unit, from $t=0$ to $t=2$.
    *   Additionally, the graph illustrates the time-varying nature of the system, as evidenced by the inequality $y_1(t-2) \neq y_2(t)$.
*   The top-right corner features another graph showing the time-varying nature of the system.
    *   The graph displays the output signal $y_1(t-2)$, which is a square wave with an amplitude of 1 and a duration of 1 unit, from $t=1$ to $t=3$.

**Textual Section:**

*   **Classification #4: Memoryless or with Memory**
    *   A memoryless system is defined as one whose output depends only on the current input and not on past or future inputs.
    *   A system with memory is one that does not meet this criterion.
*   **Types of Systems:**
    *   **Memoryless System:** A system whose output depends only on the current input and not on past or future inputs.
    *   **System with Finite Memory:** A system whose output at time $t$ depends on the input over a finite duration.
    *   **System with Infinite Memory:** A system whose output at time $t$ depends on all past inputs.
*   **Examples:**
    *   $y(t) = (t-1)x(t)$ is a memoryless system.
    *   $y(t) = (t-1)x(t) + x(t-3)$ is a system with finite memory of 3 seconds.
    *   $y[n] = y[n-1] + x[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{n} x[k]$ is an accumulator or summer system with infinite memory.

In summary, the lecture slide provides a detailed explanation of the classification of systems as memoryless or with memory, along with examples and graphical illustrations to support the concepts. The slide covers the definitions of memoryless systems, systems with finite memory, and systems with infinite memory, and provides examples of each type of system.
