|--------|---------|------------|
| \(H(z)\) | Z‑transform of an IIR filter | |
| \(H(e^{j\Omega})\) | Frequency response (evaluate \(z=e^{j\Omega}\)) | |
| \(|H(e^{j\Omega})|\) | Magnitude | |
| \(\angle H(e^{j\Omega})\) | Phase | |

**All‑Pass Filter**  
- Example: \(H(z)=z^{-3}\)  
  \[
  H(e^{j\Omega}) = e^{-j3\Omega}
  \]
  - Magnitude: \(|H|=1\) (passes all frequencies with equal gain).  
  - Phase: \(\angle H = -3\Omega\) (linear phase shift).  

**Notch Filter**  
- Cancels a single frequency \(\Omega_0\).  
- Sampling frequency to cancel a 60 Hz sinusoid:  
  \[
  \Omega_0=\frac{\pi}{2}\;\;\Rightarrow\;\; 2\pi f_{\!s}T=\frac{\pi}{2}\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;T=\frac{1}{240}\text{s}\;\Rightarrow\;f_s=240\text{ Hz}
  \]

**Pole‑Zero Map**  
- Zero at \(z=\pm j\), double pole at \(z=0\):  
  \[
  H(z)=K\,\frac{(z-j)(z+j)}{z^2}=K\,\frac{z^2+1}{z^2}
  \]
  - Magnitude at \(\Omega=0\): \(|H(e^{j0})| = 2\) (when \(K=1\)).

## 4. Transfer Functions & Frequency Response  

- **General form**  
  \[
  H(s)=k\,\frac{(s-\beta_1)(s-\beta_2)\cdots}{(s-\lambda_1)(s-\lambda_2)\cdots}
  \]
  - Zeros \(\beta_i\) → roots of numerator.  
  - Poles \(\lambda_i\) → roots of denominator.

- **Frequency response**  
  \[
  H(j\omega)=H(s)\Big|_{s=j\omega}
  \]
  - \(|H(j\omega)|\) gives amplitude; \(\angle H(j\omega)\) gives phase shift.

- **All‑pass**: \(|H(j\omega)|=1\) for all \(\omega\).  

- **Notch**: Zero at the notch frequency → cancels that frequency component.

\]
Apply Laplace:  
\[
\left(\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_i s^i\right)Y(s)
=
\left(\sum_{j=0}^{M} b_j s^j\right)X(s)

## Raw Slide Summaries

### Slide 1

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on frequency response in digital signal processing, specifically focusing on the topic of "Frequency response in DT continued" as indicated at the top. The slide is divided into two main sections, each addressing a distinct example related to filter analysis.

**Section 1: Example - Finding Frequency Response of a Filter**

*   **Filter Transfer Function:** The first example involves finding the frequency response of a filter with a transfer function given by $H[z] = z^{-3}$.
*   **Frequency Response Expression:** The frequency response $H[e^{j\Omega}]$ is derived as $\frac{1}{(e^{j\Omega})^3} = e^{-j3\Omega}$.
*   **Magnitude and Phase Response:**
    *   The magnitude of the frequency response is $|H[e^{j\Omega}]| = 1$.
    *   The phase response is $\angle H[e^{j\Omega}] = -3\Omega$.
*   **Graphical Representation:** A graph illustrates the magnitude and phase response of the filter. The magnitude response is a horizontal line at 1, indicating that the filter has a constant magnitude across all frequencies. The phase response is a straight line with a negative slope, indicating a linear phase shift.
*   **Filter Classification:** The filter is classified as an "All-pass filter" because it allows all frequencies to pass through with equal magnitude.

**Section 2: Example - Sketching Magnitude Response**

*   **Filter Transfer Function:** The second example involves a filter with a transfer function $H[z] = K \frac{(z-j)(z+j)}{(z-0)(z-0)}$.
*   **Pole-Zero Map:** A pole-zero map is provided, showing the locations of poles and zeros in the z-plane. The zeros are located at $z = j$ and $z = -j$, while there are two poles at $z = 0$.
*   **Frequency Response Expression:** By substituting $z = e^{j\Omega}$, the frequency response is expressed as $H[e^{j\Omega}] = \frac{(e^{j\Omega}-j)(e^{j\Omega}+j)}{(e^{j\Omega})^2}$.
*   **Magnitude Response:** The magnitude response is calculated as $|H[e^{j\Omega}]| = \frac{|e^{j\Omega}-j||e^{j\Omega}+j|}{|e^{j\Omega}||e^{j\Omega}|}$.
*   **Evaluation at $\Omega = 0$:** At $\Omega = 0$, the magnitude response is evaluated as $|H[e^{j0}]| = \frac{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}}{1 \cdot 1} = 2$.
*   **Graphical Representation:** Another graph shows the magnitude response of the filter, with the magnitude being 2 at $\Omega = 0$.

In summary, the lecture slide provides detailed examples and derivations for analyzing the frequency response of digital filters, including an all-pass filter and another filter with a specific pole-zero configuration. The graphical representations help visualize the magnitude and phase responses of these filters.

### Slide 2

The image presents a detailed lecture slide focused on signal processing, specifically discussing filter design and sampling frequency. The slide is divided into sections, each addressing different aspects of the topic.

**Mathematical Equations**

The top-left corner of the slide features several mathematical equations:

*   $\Sigma = \pi/2$
*   $|H[e^{j\Sigma}]| = 0 (2)$
*   $\Sigma = \pi$

These equations are accompanied by:

*   $|H[e^{j\Sigma}]| = \sqrt{2}$

**Z-Plane Diagrams**

Adjacent to the equations are two Z-plane diagrams, which are graphical representations used in signal processing to analyze and design digital filters. The diagrams illustrate the pole-zero plot of a filter, with:

*   The x-axis labeled as "Re" (real part)
*   The y-axis labeled as "Im" (imaginary part)

The diagrams show:

*   A circle with arrows pointing to specific points
*   Labels indicating the location of poles and zeros

**Notch Filter**

Below the Z-plane diagrams, the text "Notch filter" is written in red, indicating that the filter being discussed is a notch filter. A graph of the filter's frequency response is also provided, showing:

*   The magnitude of the filter's transfer function $|H[e^{j\Sigma}]|$ versus the frequency $\Sigma$

The graph illustrates the filter's ability to attenuate signals at specific frequencies.

**Example Problem**

The slide then presents an example problem:

*   "For which sampling frequency this filter will remove 60 Hz sinusoid."

The solution to this problem involves:

*   $\Sigma = \pi/2$ is removed
*   $\Sigma = \omega T$
*   $\Sigma = 2\pi fT$
*   $\pi/2 = 2\pi(60)T$
*   $T = 1/240$ s
*   $F_s = 240 Hz$

This example demonstrates how to calculate the required sampling frequency to remove a 60 Hz sinusoid using the given filter.

**Overall**

In summary, this lecture slide provides a comprehensive overview of filter design, including mathematical equations, Z-plane diagrams, and a practical example of designing a notch filter to remove a specific frequency component. The slide effectively illustrates the concepts and calculations involved in signal processing and filter design.

### Slide 3

**Properties of Unilateral Laplace and Z Transforms Part 1**

**November 11, 2025, 11:57 AM**

### 1. Time Shifting

#### Continuous Time (C.T.)

*   $\mathcal{L}[x(t)] = X(s)$
*   $\mathcal{L}[x(t-t_0)] = X(s)e^{-st_0}$
*   To explicitly include causality: $\mathcal{L}[x(t-t_0)u(t-t_0)] = X(s)e^{-st_0}$

**Example:** Find $\mathcal{L}$ of $x(t)$

*   $x(t) = u(t) - u(t-2)$
*   $X(s) = \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s}e^{-2s}$

**Diagram:** A graph with $x(t)$ on the y-axis and $t$ on the x-axis. The graph shows a rectangular function with an amplitude of 1 from $t=0$ to $t=2$.

#### Discrete Time (D.T.)

*   $\mathcal{Z}\{x[n]\} = X[z]$
*   $\mathcal{Z}\{x[n-n_0]\} = X[z]z^{-n_0}$
*   $\mathcal{Z}\{x[n-n_0]u[n-n_0]\} = X[z]z^{-n_0}$

$\mathcal{L}[u(t)] = \frac{1}{s}$

### 2. Frequency Shifting

#### Continuous Time (C.T.)

*   $\mathcal{L}[x(t)e^{s_0t}] = X(s-s_0)$

**Example:** $x(t) = e^{-at}u(t)$

*   $\mathcal{L}[u(t)] = \frac{1}{s}$
*   $\mathcal{L}[e^{-at}u(t)] = \frac{1}{s-(-a)} = \frac{1}{s+a}$

#### Discrete Time (D.T.)

*   $\mathcal{Z}\{x[n]z_0^n\} = X[\frac{z}{z_0}]$
*   $z = e^{s} = e^{\sigma + j\omega}$
*   $z_0 = e^{s_0} = e^{\sigma_0 + j\omega_0}$
*   $X[\frac{z}{z_0}] = X[\frac{e^{\sigma + j\omega}}{e^{\sigma_0 + j\omega_0}}] = X[e^{(\sigma - \sigma_0) + j(\omega - \omega_0)}]$

### 3. Scaling

*No content provided.* 

**Week 11 Page 1**

### Slide 4

The image shows a lecture slide on Laplace transforms, specifically focusing on time scaling and time differentiation properties. The content is presented in a handwritten style on graph paper.

**Time Scaling Property:**

*   The top section of the slide presents the time scaling property of Laplace transforms:
    *   $\mathcal{L}[x(t)] = X(s)$
    *   $\mathcal{L}[x(at)] = \frac{1}{a}X(\frac{s}{a})$
*   The meaning of this property is explained as:
    *   If $a > 1$: Time domain compression causes expansion in the frequency domain.
    *   If $a < 1$: Time domain expansion causes compression in the frequency domain.

**Time Differentiation Property:**

*   The main section of the slide, titled "4. Time differentiation" in red text, outlines the time differentiation property:
    *   If $\mathcal{L}[x(t)] = X(s)$, then:
        *   $\mathcal{L}[\frac{dx(t)}{dt}] = sX(s) - x(0^-)$
        *   $\mathcal{L}[\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}] = s^2X(s) - sx(0^-) - \dot{x}(0^-)$
        *   $\mathcal{L}[\frac{d^nx(t)}{dt^n}] = s^nX(s) - s^{n-1}x(0^-) - \cdots - x^{n-1}(0^-)$
    *   The notation $x^{(r)}(0^-) = \frac{d^rx}{dt^r}\Big|_{t=0^-}$ is used to represent the $r$-th derivative of $x(t)$ evaluated at $t=0^-$.

**Additional Information:**

*   The slide appears to be from Week 11, Page 2, as indicated at the bottom left corner.

### Slide 5

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on the properties of unilateral Laplace and Z transforms, specifically focusing on Part 2. The slide is divided into sections, each addressing a distinct property.

**Section 5: Frequency Differentiation**

*   **Continuous-Time (C.T.)**: The equation for frequency differentiation in continuous-time systems is given by:

    *   $L[t x(t)] = -\frac{d}{ds}X(s)$

*   **Discrete-Time (D.T.)**: The equation for frequency differentiation in discrete-time systems is:

    *   $Z\{n x[n]\} = -z \frac{d}{dz}X(z)$

**Section 6: Time Integration**

*   The equation for time integration is:

    *   $\int_{0}^{t} x(\tau) d\tau = \frac{X(s)}{s}$

**Section 7: Frequency Domain Integration**

*   The equation for frequency domain integration is:

    *   $L[\frac{x(t)}{t}] = \int_{s}^{\infty} X(\alpha) d\alpha$

**Section 8: Convolution Property**

*   **Continuous-Time**: The convolution property for continuous-time systems is:

    *   $L[x_1(t)*x_2(t)] = X_1(s) X_2(s)$

*   **Discrete-Time**: The convolution property for discrete-time systems is:

    *   $Z\{x_1[n]*x_2[n]\} = X_1(z) X_2(z)$

**Applications and Motivations #2: Finding System Response**

*   A block diagram illustrates the process of finding the system response, including:
    *   Input signal $x(t)$
    *   LTI system with impulse response $h(t)$
    *   Output signal $y(t) = x(t) * h(t)$
    *   Laplace transform of the input signal $X(s)$
    *   Laplace transform of the impulse response $H(s)$
    *   Laplace transform of the output signal $Y(s) = H(s)X(s)$

A reminder from $L$ is provided:

*   $H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} \Big|_{x(t)=e^{st}}$

An example is given:

*   An LTI system with impulse response $h(t) = -e^{3t} u(t)$ receives an input signal $x(t) = t u(t)$. The task is to find the output signal $y(t)$.

### Slide 6

The image presents a detailed, handwritten mathematical derivation on graph paper, focusing on solving a problem involving Laplace transforms and transfer functions. The content is densely packed with equations, formulas, and manipulations, indicating a step-by-step approach to finding a solution.

**Equations and Formulas:**

- The derivation starts with the convolution equation in the time domain: $y(t) = x(t) * h(t)$ and its equivalent in the Laplace domain: $Y(s) = X(s)H(s)$.
- It defines $X(s) = \mathcal{L}[t u(t)] = -\frac{d}{ds}(\frac{1}{s}) = -\left(-\frac{1}{s^2}\right) = \frac{1}{s^2}$, using property #5.
- $H(s) = \mathcal{L}[-e^{3t}u(t)] = -\frac{1}{s-3}$, using property #2.
- The product $Y(s) = H(s)X(s) = \left(\frac{-1}{s-3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{s^2}\right)$ is then manipulated in two different ways, labeled as Solution #1 and Solution #2.

**Solution #1:**

- $Y(s) = \frac{-1}{s^2(s-3)} = \frac{D}{s^2} + \frac{E}{s} + \frac{F}{s-3}$, which is then solved for $D$, $E$, and $F$.
- By equating the numerator, $D(s^2-3s) + E(s^2-3) + Fs^2 = 1$, and solving for $D$, $E$, and $F$ yields $D = \frac{1}{3}$, $E = \frac{1}{9}$, and $F = -\frac{1}{9}$.
- Thus, $Y(s) = \frac{1/3}{s^2} + \frac{1/9}{s} - \frac{1/9}{s-3}$.
- The inverse Laplace transform gives $y(t) = \frac{1}{3}tu(t) + \frac{1}{9}u(t) - \frac{1}{9}e^{3t}u(t)$.

**Solution #2:**

- $Y(s) = \left(\frac{-1}{s-3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{s^2}\right) = \frac{1}{s}[\frac{-1}{s-3}] = \frac{W(s)}{s}$.
- This leads to $y(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}[Y(s)] = \mathcal{L}^{-1}[\frac{W(s)}{s}] = \int_{0^-}^{t}w(\tau)d\tau$, where $w(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}[W(s)]$.
- $W(s) = \frac{-1}{s(s-3)} = \frac{A}{s} + \frac{B}{s-3}$, solving for $A$ and $B$ gives $A = \frac{1}{3}$ and $B = -\frac{1}{3}$.
- Hence, $W(s) = \frac{1/3}{s} - \frac{1/3}{s-3}$, and $w(t) = \frac{1}{3}u(t) - \frac{1}{3}u(t)e^{3t}$.
- Finally, $y(t) = \int_{0}^{t}[\frac{1}{3}u(\tau) - \frac{1}{3}u(\tau)e^{3\tau}]d\tau$.

**Additional Notes:**

- The image includes reminders and properties of Laplace transforms, such as $\mathcal{L}[u(t)] = \frac{1}{s}$ and $\mathcal{L}[x(t)e^{s_0t}] = X(s-s_0)$.

In summary, the image depicts a thorough mathematical derivation involving Laplace transforms, focusing on solving for $y(t)$ given $X(s)$ and $H(s)$, and presenting two solutions to the problem.

### Slide 7

The image presents a detailed, handwritten lecture slide on solving differential equations, focusing on motivations and applications. The content is divided into two main sections: the solution of governing differential equations and an example.

**Solution of Governing Differential Equations**

*   The top section of the slide features a series of equations, including:
    *   $y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} \left[\frac{1}{3}(1) - \frac{1}{3}(1)e^{3t} \right] dt$ for $t>0$
    *   $y(t) = \left[\frac{1}{3} t - \frac{1}{9} e^{3t} \right]_{0}^{t}$ for $t \geq 0$
    *   $y(t) = \frac{1}{3} (t-0) - \frac{1}{9} (e^{3t} - e^{0})$ for $t \geq 0$
    *   $y(t) = \frac{1}{3} t - \frac{1}{9} e^{3t} + \frac{1}{9}$ for $t>0$
    *   $y(t) = \left(\frac{1}{3} t - \frac{1}{9} e^{3t} + \frac{1}{9} \right) u(t)$
    *   $y(t) = \frac{1}{3} tu(t) - \frac{1}{9} e^{3t} u(t) + \frac{1}{9} u(t)$

**Motivations and Applications #3**

*   The bottom section of the slide provides information on motivations and applications, including:
    *   A general form of a differential equation:
        *   $a_0 y(t) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \frac{d^i y(t)}{dt^i} = b_0 x(t) + \sum_{j=1}^{M} b_j \frac{d^j x(t)}{dt^j}$
        *   $D^i = \frac{d^i}{dt^i}$
        *   $\left(a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i D^i \right) y(t) = \left(b_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} b_j D^j \right) x(t)$
    *   If there are no initial conditions:
        *   $\left(a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i s^i \right) Y(s) = \left(b_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} b_j s^j \right) X(s)$
    *   An example of an RLC circuit:
        *   $V_L + V_R + V_C = x(t)$
        *   $L \frac{d(y(t))}{dt} + R y(t) + \frac{1}{C} \int y(t) dt = x(t)$

The slide appears to be from a lecture on control systems or signal processing, likely in an electrical engineering or mathematics course. The equations and formulas presented are used to solve differential equations and analyze the behavior of systems.

### Slide 8

1. $L \frac{d(y(t))}{dt} + R y(t) + \frac{1}{C} \int y(t)dt = x(t)$
2. $L \ddot{y}(t) + R \dot{y}(t) + \frac{1}{C} y(t) = \dot{x} (t)$

The equation seems to describe a second-order differential equation representing an RLC circuit.

**Key Components:**

*   The variables and constants used in the equation are:
    *   $L$: Inductance
    *   $R$: Resistance
    *   $C$: Capacitance
    *   $y(t)$: Output or response of the system (likely voltage or current)
    *   $x(t)$: Input to the system (likely voltage or current)
    *   $t$: Time

**Graph Paper Background:**

*   The background of the image features a light blue graph paper with a grid pattern, providing a subtle texture to the image.
*   The grid lines are evenly spaced and run horizontally and vertically across the page.

**Additional Text:**

*   In the bottom-left corner of the image, there is small text that reads "Week 11 Page 4". This suggests that the image may be part of a lecture or presentation on a specific topic, possibly related to electrical engineering or circuit analysis.

**Overall:**

*   The image presents a clear and concise mathematical equation on a clean and simple graph paper background.
*   The equation appears to be a standard representation of an RLC circuit, and the surrounding text provides context for the equation's origin.

### Frequency Domain Big Picture

**System Responses:**
- **In Time Domain:**
  - $x(t) \rightarrow \boxed{LTI} \rightarrow y(t) = x(t) * h(t)$
  - $h(t)$ ... impulse response

- **In Frequency Domain:**
  - $X(s) \rightarrow \boxed{LTI} \rightarrow Y(s) = X(s)H(s)$
  - $H(s)$ ... Transfer Function

**Equations and Definitions:**

- $H(s) = \mathcal{L}\{h(t)\}$
- General form: $H(s) = k \frac{(s-\alpha_1)(s-\alpha_2)...}{(s-z_1)(s-z_2)...}$
  - roots: zeros
  - roots: poles

- Frequency Response: $H(j\omega) = H(s)$ when $s = j\omega$

### Slide 10

The image presents a detailed lecture slide focused on the application of the z-transform in signal processing, specifically exploring its properties and utilizing tables to find transforms. The content is densely packed with mathematical expressions, tables, and handwritten notes.

**Mathematical Expressions and Derivations:**

* The top section of the slide begins with the equation:
  \[ 
  t \cdot x_1(t) = - \left( -t x_1(t) \right)
  \]
  and 
  \[
  -t e^{-t} u(t-t) \Leftrightarrow -\frac{d}{ds} X_1(s) = -\frac{d}{ds} \left( \frac{1}{s+1} e^{-(s+1)t} \right)
  \]
  These equations illustrate the scaling property and derivative property of the Laplace transform, respectively.

**Tables and Problem Statement:**

* Below the initial equations, there are references to "TABLE 5.1" and "TABLE 5.2," which are not directly visible but presumably contain a list of z-transform pairs and properties, respectively.
* The problem statement "5.1-6. Using Tables 5.1 and 5.2, find the Z-Transform of..." is followed by three parts:
  * a. \(u[n] - u[n-2]\)
  * b. \(\gamma^{n-2} u[n-2]\)
  * c. \(n \gamma^n u[n-1]\)

**Solutions and Handwritten Notes:**

* **Part a:**
  * \(u[n] - u[n-2] = \delta[n] + \delta[n-1]\)
  * The z-transform is calculated as \(Z\{\delta[n]\} + Z\{\delta[n-1]\} = 1 + z^{-1}\)
* **Part b:**
  * Includes a note about time shifting: \(\gamma^{n-2} u[n-2] \rightarrow \gamma^n u[n]\) (implying a transformation to a form that can be looked up in the tables).
* **Part c:**
  * Begins with \(n \gamma^n u[n-1]\).
  * A note indicates that \(n \gamma^n u[n-1] = n \gamma^n u[n]\) because the signal is 0 at \(n=0\) anyway due to multiplication by \(n\).
  * The z-transform of \(\gamma^n u[n]\) is \(\frac{z}{z-\gamma}\), and using the property that \(n(\gamma^n u[n]) \Leftrightarrow -z \frac{d}{dz} \left[ \frac{z}{z-\gamma} \right]\), the transform for part c is derived.

**Tables 5.1 and 5.2:**

* Although not directly shown, Table 5.1 presumably lists common z-transform pairs, such as:
  + \(\delta[n] \Leftrightarrow 1\)
  + \(u[n] \Leftrightarrow \frac{z}{z-1}\)
  + \(\gamma^n u[n] \Leftrightarrow \frac{z}{z-\gamma}\)
* Table 5.2 likely outlines z-transform properties, including:
  + Linearity
  + Time shifting
  + Scaling
  + Convolution

**Conclusion:**

The slide provides a comprehensive overview of applying z-transform properties and tables to solve problems in signal processing. It demonstrates how to use the z-transform to analyze discrete-time signals and systems, leveraging properties such as time shifting, scaling, and differentiation in the z-domain.

### Slide 11

## Detailed Summary of Lecture Slide

### Text Content

The slide discusses a second-order system with a pole-zero plot shown in Figure P4.8-5. The response of this system is given by $H(0) = -1$.

#### Part (a)

* The transfer function $H(s)$ is expressed as:
  \[ H(s) = k \frac{s^2 + b_1 s + b_2}{s^2 + a_1 s + a_2} \]
* The objective is to determine the constants $k$, $b_1$, $b_2$, $a_1$, and $a_2$.

#### Part (b)

* The input to the system is $x(t) = 4 + \cos (t/2 + \pi/3)$.
* The task is to find the output $y(t)$ of the system in response to this input.

### Equations and Formulas

* The transfer function $H(s)$ can be factored into:
  \[ H(s) = k \frac{(s - \beta_1)(s - \beta_2)}{(s - \lambda_1)(s - \lambda_2)} \]
  where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the zeros, and $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the poles.
* The given transfer function is:
  \[ H(s) = k \frac{s^2 + 9/4}{s^2 + 2s + 5/4} \]
* By comparing coefficients:
  \[ H(s) = k \frac{s^2 + b_1 s + b_2}{s^2 + a_1 s + a_2} \]
  it is found that:
  \[ b_1 = 0, \quad b_2 = 9/4, \quad a_1 = 2, \quad a_2 = 5/4 \]
* The value of $k$ is determined using $H(j0) = -1$:
  \[ H(j0) = k \frac{0^2 + 9/4}{0^2 + 0 + 5/4} = -1 \]
  \[ k \frac{9/4}{5/4} = -1 \]
  \[ k = -\frac{5}{9} \]
* The full transfer function is:
  \[ H(s) = \left(-\frac{5}{9}\right) \frac{s^2 + 9/4}{s^2 + 2s + 5/4} \]

### Pole-Zero Plot Description

The pole-zero plot in Figure P4.8-5 shows:

* Two poles: $\lambda_1 = -1 + j0.5$ and $\lambda_2 = -1 - j0.5$
* Two zeros: $\beta_1 = 0 + j1.5$ and $\beta_2 = 0 - j1.5$

The plot has:

* A real axis ($\sigma$) ranging from -2 to 2
* An imaginary axis ($j\omega$) ranging from -2 to 2
* Poles marked with $\times$ at $(-1, 0.5)$ and $(-1, -0.5)$
* Zeros marked with $\circ$ at $(0, 1.5)$ and $(0, -1.5)$
