### Slide 3

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on the topic of system transfer functions, specifically focusing on the Laplace transform and its application in analyzing system behavior.

**Equations and Formulas:**

The slide begins by introducing the convolution integral:

\[y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\tau) e^{s(t-\tau)} d\tau\]

This is then manipulated through several steps:

\[y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\tau) e^{st} e^{-s\tau} d\tau\]

\[y(t) = e^{st} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\tau) e^{-s\tau} d\tau\]

\[y(t) = e^{st} H(s)\]

where

\[H(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\tau) e^{-s\tau} d\tau\]

is defined as the Laplace transform of $h(t)$.

The relationship between the input $x(t)$, output $y(t)$, and the system transfer function $H(s)$ is given by:

\[y(t) = x(t) |H(s)|_{x(t)=e^{st}} \rightarrow \text{output}\]

\[H(s) = \frac{y(t)}{x(t)} |_{x(t)=e^{st}} \rightarrow \text{input}\]

**Definitions and Key Points:**

*   For a given $s$, $H(s)$ is constant; the output is the input multiplied by a constant.
*   Since $e^{st}$ passes through the system, it is called an eigenfunction of the system.

**Laplace Transform:**

For an arbitrary $x(t)$:

*   $X(s) = L[x(t)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt$
*   $H(s) = L[h(t)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t) e^{-st} dt$

**Diagrams/Images:**

There are no diagrams or images on this slide; the content is purely textual and consists of mathematical equations and formulas.

**Additional Information:**

The slide is identified as "Week 9 Page 3" at the bottom, indicating it is part of a series of lecture notes or slides for a course, likely in the field of signal processing, control systems, or a related engineering discipline. The content suggests that the lecture is covering the basics of system analysis using the Laplace transform, a crucial tool for understanding and designing systems in the frequency domain.

### Slide 4

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on the Z-transform, specifically focusing on DT-LTI (Discrete-Time Linear Time-Invariant) systems. The slide is divided into several sections, each addressing a particular aspect of the Z-transform.

**Title and Date**
The title "Z-transform (DT-LTI) (3.8.2; 5.1)" is displayed at the top-left corner, accompanied by the date "October 28, 2015" and time "8:55 AM".

**Equations and Formulas**
The top-left section of the slide features a series of equations and formulas related to the Z-transform, including:

* $e^{st} = z = e^{sn}$
* $e = z^{\frac{1}{n}} = e^{\frac{s}{n}} = e^{\frac{\sigma + j\omega}{n}} = e^{\frac{\sigma}{n}}e^{\frac{j\omega}{n}}$
* $|z| = |e^{s}| = |e^{\sigma + j\omega}| = e^{\sigma}\sqrt{cos\omega + jsin\omega}$
* $|z| = |e^{s}| = 1$

These equations appear to derive the relationship between the Z-transform and the complex exponential function.

**Images and Names**
Two black-and-white photographs are displayed at the top-right corner of the slide, accompanied by the names:

* Lotfi A. Zadeh (1921-2017)
* John R. Ragazzini (1912-1988)

These individuals are likely pioneers in the field of control systems or signal processing.

**Z-transform Derivation**
The main body of the slide presents a step-by-step derivation of the Z-transform for an LTI system with impulse response $h[n]$ and input $x[n] = z^n$:

* $y[n] = x[n] * h[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} h[m] x[n-m]$
* $y[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} h[m] z^{n-m}$
* $y[n] = z^n \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} h[m] z^{-m}$
* $H[z] = \mathcal{Z}\{h[n]\} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} h[m] z^{-m}$

The derivation leads to the definition of the transfer function:

* $H[z] = \frac{y[n]}{x[n]}$

**Arbitrary $x[n]$**
The final section of the slide addresses the Z-transform for an arbitrary $x[n]$:

* $\mathcal{Z}\{x[n]\} = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[m] z^{-m}$

**Additional Notes**

### Slide 5

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on the topic of poles and zeros, dated October 28, 2025, at 11:39 AM. The slide is divided into two main sections: the definition of poles and zeros in the context of transfer functions $H(s)$ and $H[z]$, and their representation in fractional form.

**Definitions of Poles and Zeros**

*   **Poles and Zeros in $H(s)$:**
    *   A system has a pole at $s = a$ if $|H(a)| = \infty$
    *   A system has a zero at $s = b$ if $|H(b)| = 0$
*   **Poles and Zeros in $H[z]$:**
    *   A system has a pole at $z = a$ if $|H[a]| = \infty$
    *   A system has a zero at $z = b$ if $|H[b]| = 0$

**Representation of Poles and Zeros**

*   The symbols $\times$ and $\circ$ are used to represent poles and zeros, respectively.

**Fractional Form of $H(s)$**

*   The transfer function $H(s)$ is often expressed in fractional form as:
    *   $H(s) = \frac{a_ms^m + a_{m-1}s^{m-1} + a_{m-2}s^{m-2} + \cdots + a_0}{b_ns^n + b_{n-1}s^{n-1} + b_{n-2}s^{n-2} + \cdots + b_0}$
*   In this form:
    *   The roots of the numerator are the zeros ($\circ$)
    *   The roots of the denominator are the poles ($\times$)

In summary, the slide provides a clear and concise overview of the concepts of poles and zeros in the context of transfer functions $H(s)$ and $H[z]$, along with their representation in fractional form. The use of symbols $\times$ and $\circ$ to denote poles and zeros, respectively, adds a visual aid to understanding these complex concepts.

### Slide 6

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on the Region of Convergence (ROC) in signal processing, specifically focusing on Part 1. The slide is divided into two main sections, each addressing a distinct aspect of ROC.

**Section 1: Continuous-Time Signals**

*   **Definition and Example**
    *   The ROC is defined as the region of the complex plane where the Laplace transform $L$ or $L$ converges.
    *   An example is provided with $h(t) = e^{-at}u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is the unit step function.
*   **Laplace Transform Calculation**
    *   The Laplace transform $H(s)$ of $h(t)$ is calculated as:
        \[H(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t)e^{-st} dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-at}e^{-st} dt\]
    *   The calculation yields:
        \[H(s) = \frac{1}{s+a}\]
*   **Region of Convergence (ROC)**
    *   The ROC is determined by the condition $\text{Re}(-(s+a)) > 0$, which simplifies to $\text{Re}(s) > -a$.
    *   This indicates that the ROC is the region to the right of the vertical line $s = -a$ in the complex plane.
*   **Pole Location**
    *   The pole of $H(s)$ is located at $s = -a$, marked with an "X" on the $s$-plane.

**Section 2: Discrete-Time Signals**

*   **Definition and Example**
    *   For discrete-time signals, the ROC is defined for the $z$-transform.
    *   An example is given with $h[n] = a^n u[n]$, where $|a| < 1$.
*   **$z$-Transform Calculation**
    *   The $z$-transform $H[z]$ of $h[n]$ is calculated as:
        \[H[z] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} h[n]z^{-n} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a^n z^{-n} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{a}{z}\right)^n\]
    *   The calculation yields:
        \[H[z] = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{a}{z}} = \frac{z}{z-a}\]
*   **Region of Convergence (ROC)**
    *   The ROC is determined by the condition $|\frac{a}{z}| < 1$, which simplifies to $|z| > |a|$.
    *   This indicates that the ROC is the region outside the circle of radius $|a|$ centered at the origin in the $z$-plane.
*   **Pole and Zero Locations**
    *   The pole of $H[z]$ is located at $z = a$, marked with an "X" on the $z$-plane.
    *   The zero of $H[z]$ is located at $z = 0$, marked with an "O" on the $z$-plane.

In summary, the lecture slide provides a comprehensive overview of the Region of Convergence (ROC) for both continuous-time and discrete-time signals, including definitions, examples, transform calculations, and graphical representations of the ROC, poles, and zeros in the complex plane.

### Slide 7

The image presents a comprehensive collection of mathematical equations and graphs related to signal processing, specifically focusing on the Laplace transform and Z-transform. The content is organized into two columns, with the left column dedicated to the Laplace transform and the right column focused on the Z-transform.

**Laplace Transform (Left Column)**

*   **Definition and Example**
    *   The Laplace transform of a function $h(t)$ is defined as $H(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t)e^{-st}dt$.
    *   An example is provided with $h(t) = -e^{-at}u(-t)$, where $u(-t)$ is the unit step function.
*   **Derivation of $H(s)$**
    *   The derivation involves substituting $h(t)$ into the Laplace transform definition: $H(s) = -\int_{-\infty}^{0} e^{-at}e^{-st}dt$.
    *   This simplifies to $H(s) = -\left[\frac{e^{-(s+a)t}}{-(s+a)}\right]_{-\infty}^{0}$.
    *   Further simplification yields $H(s) = \frac{1}{s+a}$, valid for $Re[-(s+a)] > 0$ or $Re(s) < -a$.
*   **Region of Convergence (ROC)**
    *   The ROC is defined as $Re(s) < -a$, indicating that the transform converges for all $s$ with a real part less than $-a$.
    *   A graph illustrates the ROC in the s-plane, showing the region where the transform is valid.

**Z-Transform (Right Column)**

*   **Definition and Example**
    *   The Z-transform of a discrete-time signal $h[n]$ is defined as $H[z] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} h[n]z^{-n}$.
    *   An example is given with $h[n] = -a^n u[-n-1]$, where $u[-n-1]$ is the unit step function for negative indices.
*   **Derivation of $H[z]$**
    *   Substituting $h[n]$ into the Z-transform definition yields $H[z] = -\sum_{n=-\infty}^{-1} a^n z^{-n}$.
    *   By changing the index, this becomes $H[z] = -\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} a^{-m} z^{m}$, which can be expressed as $H[z] = -\frac{\frac{z}{a}}{1-\frac{z}{a}} = \frac{z}{z-a}$ for $|z| < |a|$.
*   **Region of Convergence (ROC)**
    *   The ROC for this example is $|z| < |a|$, indicating that the transform converges for all $z$ within a circle of radius $|a|$ centered at the origin.
    *   A graph in the z-plane illustrates this ROC.

**Summary**

*   The bottom section provides a summary of key points, including:
    *   The Laplace transform example: $h(t) = e^{-at}u(t)$, with $H(s) = \frac{1}{s+a}$ and ROC $Re(s) > -a$.
    *   The Z-transform example: $h[n] = a^n u[n]$, with $H[z] = \frac{z}{z-a}$ and ROC $|z| > |a|$.

In conclusion, the image offers a detailed exploration of both the Laplace and Z-transforms, including their definitions, derivations, and regions of convergence, along with illustrative examples and graphical representations.

### Slide 8

**Continuous-Time (C.T.) System Analysis**

*   **Transfer Function and Impulse Response**
    *   The transfer function $H(s) = \frac{1}{s+a}$ is provided, with the region of convergence (ROC) specified as $Re(s) < -a$. This indicates that the system is stable if the real part of $s$ is less than $-a$.
    *   The impulse response $h(t) = -e^{-at}u(-t)$ is given, where $u(-t)$ represents the unit step function. This implies that the system's response to an impulse input is a decaying exponential function for $t < 0$.
    *   A pole is located at $s = -a$, which is marked on the s-plane diagram. The ROC is shaded to the left of the pole, indicating that the system is stable.
*   **S-Plane Diagram**
    *   The s-plane diagram shows the pole location at $s = -a$ and the ROC shaded to the left of the pole.

**Discrete-Time (D.T.) System Analysis**

*   **Transfer Function and Impulse Response**
    *   The transfer function $H[z] = \frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}$ is provided, with the ROC specified as $|z| > |a|$. This indicates that the system is stable if the magnitude of $z$ is greater than $|a|$.
    *   The impulse response $h[n] = -a^n u[-n-1]$ is given, where $u[-n-1]$ represents the unit step function. This implies that the system's response to an impulse input is a decaying exponential sequence for $n < 0$.
    *   A pole is located at $z = a$, which is marked on the z-plane diagram. The ROC is shaded outside a circle of radius $|a|$ centered at the origin.
*   **Z-Plane Diagram**
    *   The z-plane diagram shows the pole location at $z = a$ and the ROC shaded outside a circle of radius $|a|$ centered at the origin. A zero is located at $z = 0$.

In summary, the lecture slide provides a detailed analysis of both continuous-time and discrete-time systems, including their transfer functions, impulse responses, and stability criteria. The s-plane and z-plane diagrams help visualize the pole and zero locations, as well as the regions of convergence for each system.

### Slide 11

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on Continuous-Time (CT) Convolution, covering the conceptual motivation, mathematical definitions, and an example problem.

**Slide Header**
The top of the slide displays:
- "W9 Tutorial: CT Convolution"
- "Tuesday, October 28, 2025"
- "9:00 AM"

**Quick Review**
The slide begins with a quick review of convolution, noting it was covered procedurally on the midterm. The conceptual motivation is provided as: "Allows us to use the impulse response of an LTI system to determine the system's output to any possible input."

**Equations and Definitions**
The following equations and definitions are listed:

1. **Discrete-Time (DT) Convolution Sum**:
   \[
   y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k]h[n-k]
   \]

2. **Continuous-Time (CT) Convolution Integral** (Focus of today):
   \[
   y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau)h(t-\tau) d\tau = x(t) * h(t)
   \]

**Examples**
An example is provided to determine the response of a system with an impulse response, \(h(t)\), to an input, \(x(t)\).

**Example 1: Determine the response of the system with impulse response, \(h(t)\), given below to the input, \(x(t)\), also given below. Comment on the effect the system has on the input.**

- Two graphs are shown:
  - \(h(t) = (1 - \frac{1}{2}t)u(t)\) for \(0 \leq t \leq 2\)
  - \(x(t) = u(t) - u(t-1)\)

**Flip and Slide Process for Convolution**
The process involves:
- Flipping \(h(t)\) to get \(h(-t)\)
- Sliding it over \(x(t)\) as \(t\) varies.

**Regions for Evaluation**
The evaluation of the integral is divided into regions based on \(t\):
1. **Region 1: \(t < 0\) (no overlap of \(x, h\))**
   \[
   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau)h(t-\tau) d\tau = 0 = y(t)
   \]

2. **Region 2: \(0 \leq t < 2\) (partial overlap of \(x, h\))**
   \[
   \int_{0}^{t} x(\tau)h(t-\tau) d\tau
   \]
   Detailed calculation is shown, leading to:
   \[
   y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} [1 - \frac{1}{2}(t-\tau)] d\tau
   \]
   \[
   = \int_{0}^{t} (\frac{1}{2}\tau + 1 - \frac{1}{2}t) d\tau
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{t} (\tau + 2 - t) d\tau
   \]

The detailed step-by-step calculation for \(y(t)\) in Region 2 is provided but not fully solved in the given text. 

This summary captures all the content from the lecture slide, including equations, definitions, and the example problem setup.

### Slide 12

The image presents a detailed lecture slide focused on signal processing and systems theory, specifically covering the topics of convolution, impulse responses, and linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The slide is densely populated with mathematical equations, diagrams, and explanatory notes.

**Mathematical Equations and Derivations:**

The top section of the slide features a series of mathematical equations and derivations related to convolution and impulse responses. These include:

*   The convolution integral: $y(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{t^2}{2} + (2-t)\tau \right]_{\tau=0}^{t} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{t^2}{2} + 2t - t^2 - 0 \right] = t - \frac{t^2}{4}$
*   The definition of $y(t)$ as a piecewise function:
    *   $y(t) = \begin{cases} 0 & t<0 \\ t-\frac{t^2}{4} & 0 \leq t < 2 \\ 1 & 2 \leq t \end{cases}$

**Diagrams and Graphs:**

The slide includes two diagrams:

*   A graph illustrating the input signal $x(t)$, the impulse response $h(t)$, and the output signal $y(t)$ over time. The graph shows how the system smooths the input signal.
*   A simple block diagram representing an LTI system with an input $\delta(t)$ and an output $h(t)$.

**Key Concepts and Definitions:**

The slide highlights several key concepts and definitions:

*   **Region 3:** $2 \leq t$ (full overlap)
*   **Aside:** What is the impulse response and how can we use it?
*   **Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems:** A system that is both linear and time-invariant.
*   **Impulse Response:** The output of an LTI system when the input is an impulse $\delta(t)$.
*   **Convolution:** A mathematical operation that combines two functions by sliding one function over the other.

**Key Ideas and Takeaways:**

The slide concludes with two key ideas:

*   **Any arbitrary input $x(t)$ can be thought of as a linear combination of many shifted impulses.**
*   **The output is a linear combination of shifted impulse responses:** $y(t) = h(t) + h(t-T)$

Overall, the slide provides a comprehensive overview of the concepts and mathematical tools used in signal processing and systems theory, including convolution, impulse responses, and LTI systems.

### Slide 13

The image presents a detailed explanation of the concept of convolution in signal processing, specifically addressing the question of why the impulse response is flipped during the convolution process.

**Top Section:**

* The top section begins with a thought experiment involving an infinite series of impulses, each scaled by the input signal at a specific time $t$. This is represented by the equation:

$x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) \delta(t-\tau) d\tau$

* The text explains that if we had an impulse at every possible $t$ and added them all up, it would represent $x(t)$ exactly.
* The output $y(t)$ is then expressed as:

$y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d\tau$

* This is identified as the convolution operation.

**Aside 2: Why Flip During Convolution?**

* The section "Aside 2: Why flip during convolution?" delves into the reason behind flipping the impulse response $h(t)$ during convolution.
* It considers passing an impulse as input to a system with an impulse response $h(t)$.

**Graphs and Equations:**

* Two graphs are presented:
	+ The first graph shows $h(t)$ and $x(t) = \delta(t)$.
	+ The second graph illustrates the process of flipping and shifting $h(t)$ across the $\tau$-axis as $t$ varies.
* The text explains that as we slide the flipped $h$ across the $\tau$-axis (varying $t$), the impulse response is reproduced.

**Key Takeaways:**

* The flipping of the impulse response $h(t)$ during convolution is a crucial step in the process.
* The convolution operation can be understood as sliding the flipped impulse response across the input signal and integrating the product at each position.

Overall, the image provides a clear and detailed explanation of the convolution process and the importance of flipping the impulse response.

### Slide 14

The image presents a detailed analysis of a system's response to a sinusoidal input, with the impulse response $h(t)$ provided. The goal is to determine the response of the system, denoted as $y(t)$, assuming it is initially at rest.

**Initial Conditions and Input**

*   The input is one period of a sinusoid with frequency $\omega = 1$ rad/s.
*   The impulse response $h(t)$ is given.
*   The system is initially at rest.

**Convolution Equation**

The convolution equation for the response $y(t)$ is:

$$
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau)h(t-\tau) d\tau
$$

**Plot of Convolution Equation**

The plot of the convolution equation is shown, with $x(\tau)$ and $h(t-\tau)$ graphed against $\tau$. The plot illustrates the process of convolving $x(\tau)$ and $h(t-\tau)$.

**Regions of Overlap**

The analysis is divided into four regions based on the overlap between $x(\tau)$ and $h(t-\tau)$:

### Region 1: No Overlap for $t<0$

*   In this region, there is no overlap between $x(\tau)$ and $h(t-\tau)$, resulting in $y(t) = 0$.

### Region 2: Partial, Increasing Overlap ($0 \leq t < 2\pi$)

*   The overlap between $x(\tau)$ and $h(t-\tau)$ increases as $t$ increases from $0$ to $2\pi$.
*   The response $y(t)$ is calculated as:

    $$
    y(t) = \int_{0}^{t} 1 \cdot \sin(\tau) d\tau = [-\cos(\tau)]_{0}^{t} = 1 - \cos(t)
    $$

### Region 3: Partial Decreasing Overlap ($2\pi \leq t < 4\pi$)

*   The overlap between $x(\tau)$ and $h(t-\tau)$ decreases as $t$ increases from $2\pi$ to $4\pi$.
*   The response $y(t)$ is calculated as:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    y(t) &= \int_{t-2\pi}^{2\pi} 1 \cdot \sin(\tau) d\tau = [-\cos(\tau)]_{t-2\pi}^{2\pi} \\
    &= -\cos(2\pi) + \cos(t-2\pi) \\
    &= -1 + \cos(t) \\
    y(t) &= \cos(t) - 1
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### Region 4: No Overlap ($t \geq 4\pi$)

*   In this region, there is no overlap between $x(\tau)$ and $h(t-\tau)$, resulting in $y(t) = 0$.

**Final Response**

The final response $y(t)$ is summarized as:

$$
y(t) = \begin{cases}
0 & t<0 \\
1-\cos(t) & 0 \leq t < 2\pi \\
\cos(t)-1 & 2\pi \leq t < 4\pi \\
0 & t \geq 4\pi
\end{cases}
$$

The plot of $y(t)$ is also provided, showing the response of the system to the sinusoidal input.

### Slide 15

The image presents a slide with handwritten notes, likely from a lecture on signal processing or a related field. The content is as follows:

*   The top-left corner features the equation: $u(t) = \begin{cases} 0 & t < 0 \\ 1 & t \geq 0 \end{cases}$
*   In the top-right corner, there is a simple graph with a curved line that opens downward, resembling a parabola or a segment of a circle. However, the exact nature of this curve is not specified due to the hand-drawn and blurry nature of the image.
*   Below the equation and graph, there is a statement written in cursive: "In general: LTI systems don't change the frequency of sinusoidal inputs. important note for the Laplace and Fourier transforms (upcoming)"

The main points of this slide are:

*   **Equation of a unit step function**: $u(t) = \begin{cases} 0 & t < 0 \\ 1 & t \geq 0 \end{cases}$
*   **Graph**: A simple, curved line in the top-right corner
*   **Statement about LTI systems**: LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) systems do not change the frequency of sinusoidal inputs, which is an important note for upcoming discussions on Laplace and Fourier transforms.
