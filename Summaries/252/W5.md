## 1.  System Classification  

| Property | Definition | Key Example | Quick Intuition |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Causal** | Output at time t depends only on current/past inputs | `y(t)=x(t)-x(t-2)` | “You can’t hear the future.” |
| **Non‑causal** | Output may depend on future inputs | `y(t)=x(t+1)+x(t)` | “Look ahead like a video editor.” |
| **Stable (BIBO)** | Every bounded input → bounded output | `y[n] = (1/3)(x[n-1]+x[n]+x[n+1])` | “The system won’t blow up.” |
| **Unstable** | Some bounded input gives unbounded output | `y(t)=t^2 x(t)` with `x(t)=u(t)` | “Think of a runaway amplifier.” |

> **Tip**: For LTI systems, *stability* ⇔ the impulse response is absolutely summable/ integrable:  
> `∑|h[n]| < ∞`  (discrete) or  `∫|h(t)|dt < ∞`  (continuous).

---

## 2.  BIBO Stability (Bounded‑Input, Bounded‑Output)  

- **Definition**  
  `|x(t)| ≤ M_x  ⇒  |y(t)| ≤ M_y`  (continuous)  
  `|x[n]| ≤ M_x  ⇒  |y[n]| ≤ M_y`  (discrete)  

- **Why it matters**  
  Guarantees that a system will never produce infinite output for any finite‑energy signal.

- **Checking an LTI system**  
  1. Find `h(t)` or `h[n]`.  
  2. Test absolute summability.  
  3. If true → BIBO stable; otherwise → unstable.

- **Example (discrete)**  
  `y[n] = (1/3)(x[n]+x[n+1]+x[n+2])`  
  `|y[n]| ≤ (1/3)(M_x+M_x+M_x) = M_x`  → stable.

- **Example (continuous)**  
  `y(t)=t^2x(t)` with `x(t)=u(t)` → `|y(t)| → ∞` as `t→∞` → unstable.

---

## 3.  Linearity vs. Non‑Linearity  

| Property | Linear System | Non‑Linear System |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Additivity** | `T{x1+x2} = T{x1}+T{x2}` | Often violated |
| **Homogeneity (Scaling)** | `T{αx} = αT{x}` | Often violated |
| **Superposition** | `T{a x1 + b x2} = aT{x1} + bT{x2}` | Not guaranteed |

- **Linear example**  
  `y(t) = t x(t)` – satisfies superposition (check by substitution).

- **Non‑linear examples**  
  - `y(t) = x^3(t)` (scaling → `K^3`, not `K`).  
  - `y[n] = Re{ x[n] }` (real part destroys scaling).

> **Analogy**: A linear system is like a perfectly elastic spring—double the input, double the output.  
> A non‑linear system is like a rubber band—it stretches differently depending on how hard you pull.

## 4.  Impulse Response & Convolution  

### 4.1  Impulse Response (`h(t)` / `h[n]`)

- The output when the input is an impulse:  
  `x(t)=δ(t) → y(t)=h(t)` (continuous)  
  `x[n]=δ[n] → y[n]=h[n]` (discrete)

- **Why it matters**: For any input, the output can be built from `h`.

### 4.2  Convolution (Discrete)

- **Definition**  
  `y[n] = (x * h)[n] = ∑_{m=-∞}^{∞} x[m] h[n-m]`

- **Decomposition trick**  
  Every discrete signal can be written as  
  `x[n] = ∑_{m} x[m] δ[n-m]`  
  → `x[n] * h[n] = ∑_{m} x[m] h[n-m]`

- **Scaling & Shifting**  
  `δ[n-m] * h[n] = h[n-m]` (time‑shift property)  
  `x[m] δ[n-m] * h[n] = x[m] h[n-m]` (scaling property)

- **Moving‑average filter (example)**  
  `y[n] = (1/3)(x[n-1]+x[n]+x[n+1])`  
  → `h[n] = (1/3)(δ[n+1]+δ[n]+δ[n-1])`

### 4.3  Convolution (Continuous)

- `y(t) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} x(τ) h(t-τ) dτ`

---

## 5.  Practical Takeaways  

- **Causality** → implementable in real‑time; **Non‑causality** → useful for offline filtering (e.g., smoothing).  
- **Stability** → check impulse response; unstable LTI systems are dangerous (think of a bridge collapse).  
- **Linearity** → superposition holds; simplifies analysis using impulse response and convolution.  
- **Impulse response** → the “fingerprint” of an LTI system; once known, any input’s output follows by convolution.  
- **Convolution** → the mathematical way to blend an input with a system’s impulse response.  

Use this sheet to quickly recall the core concepts, key formulas, and intuitive ideas that will help you tackle any exam question on signal and system analysis.

## Raw Slide Summaries

### Slide 1

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on the classification of systems, specifically focusing on causal and noncausal systems, as well as stable and unstable systems.

*   **Classification #5 Causal/noncausal System**
    *   A system is causal if its output signals depend on its past and present input signals. 
    *   OR 
    *   output cannot start before the input. 
    *   A noncausal system is otherwise.
*   **Example:**
    *   A graph showing a noncausal system with an input signal x(t) and an output signal y(t) is provided, illustrating that the output starts before the input.
*   **Examples of Causal and Noncausal Systems:**
    *   $y(t) = x(t) - x(t-2)$: Causal
    *   $y(t) = x(t) - x(t-2) + 5u(t-10)$: Causal
    *   $y(t) = x(t+1) + x(t)$: NonCausal
    *   $y[n] = x[n+3] + x[n-3]$: NonCausal
*   **Properties of Noncausal Systems:**
    *   NonCausal systems are not realizable in real time but useful for offline processing.
*   **Example of a Moving Average System:**
    *   $y[n] = \frac{1}{3}(x[n-1] + x[n] + x[n+1])$
    *   A graph showing the input signal x[n] and the output signal y[n] is provided, illustrating a smoothing application.
*   **Classification #6 Stable and Unstable System**
    *   A black-and-white video still image of a bridge is shown, but no specific details or equations are provided for this classification.

In summary, the lecture slide provides a comprehensive overview of causal and noncausal systems, including their definitions, examples, and properties. It also touches on the concept of stable and unstable systems, although the latter is not elaborated upon in detail. The examples and graphs provided help to illustrate the key concepts and make the material more accessible to the audience.

### Slide 2

The image presents a detailed lecture slide focused on the topic of Bounded Input/Bounded Output (BIBO) stability in systems. The slide is divided into several sections, each addressing a specific aspect of BIBO stability.

**Header Section:**
At the top of the slide, a header features a photograph of the Tacoma Bridge collapse, accompanied by the title "TACOMA BRIDGE COLLAPSE" in white text on a blue background. This visual element likely serves to illustrate the consequences of instability in systems.

**Definition and Conditions for BIBO Stability:**
The main content of the slide begins with a definition of BIBO stability:

"A system is bounded input / bounded output stable BIBO if and only if every bounded input results in a bounded output."

This is followed by mathematical conditions for BIBO stability:

- For Continuous Time (C.T.): $|x(t)| \leq M_x < \infty \longrightarrow |y(t)| \leq M_y < \infty$
- For Discrete Time (D.T.): $|x[n]| \leq M_x < \infty \longrightarrow |y[n]| \leq M_y < \infty$

Where $M_x$ and $M_y$ are positive finite numbers.

**Example 1: Discrete Time System**
An example of a discrete-time system is provided:

$y[n] = \frac{1}{3}(x[n] + x[n+1] + x[n+2])$

The analysis shows that if $x[n]$ is bounded, i.e., $|x[n]| \leq M_x < \infty$, then $y[n]$ is also bounded:

$|y[n]| = \frac{1}{3}|x[n] + x[n+1] + x[n+2]|$

Using the property that $|a+b+c| \leq |a| + |b| + |c|$, we get:

$|y[n]| \leq \frac{1}{3}(|x[n]| + |x[n+1]| + |x[n+2]|)$

Given $|x[n]| \leq M_x$, it follows that:

$|y[n]| \leq \frac{1}{3}(M_x + M_x + M_x) < \infty$

This demonstrates that the system is BIBO stable.

**Example 2: Continuous Time System**
Another example examines a continuous-time system:

$y(t) = t^2x(t)$

With $x(t) = u(t)$ (a bounded input, specifically a unit step function), we have:

$y(t) = t^2u(t)$

The magnitude of $y(t)$ is:

$|y(t)| = |t^2u(t)|$

As $t \rightarrow \infty$, $|y(t)| \rightarrow \infty$, indicating an unbounded output for a bounded input. Therefore, this system is not BIBO stable.

**Graphical Representation:**
A simple graph is included, depicting a unit step function $u(t)$, which is a common input used in control systems analysis.

In summary, the slide provides a comprehensive overview of BIBO stability, including its definition, conditions, and illustrative examples in both discrete and continuous time domains. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring that systems produce bounded outputs for any bounded input, highlighting the consequences of instability with the reference to the Tacoma Bridge collapse.

### Slide 3

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on the classification of systems as linear or nonlinear, focusing on the properties that define these classifications.

**Top Section:**
The top section of the slide includes a note about BIBO (Bounded-Input Bounded-Output) stability. It states that if $t \rightarrow \infty$, then $|y(t)| \rightarrow \infty$ implies an unbounded output and BIBO instability.

**Classification #7: Linear vs. Nonlinear**
This section delves into the characteristics of linear systems, highlighting two key properties:

1. **Additive Property:**
   - If $x_1(t) \rightarrow y_1(t)$ and $x_2(t) \rightarrow y_2(t)$, then for a linear system, $x_1(t) + x_2(t) \rightarrow y_1(t) + y_2(t)$.

2. **Scaling Property:**
   - If $x_1(t) \rightarrow y_1(t)$, then for a linear system, $Kx_1(t) \rightarrow Ky_1(t)$.

These properties can be combined into the **Superposition Property:**
- If $x_1(t) \rightarrow y_1(t)$ and $x_2(t) \rightarrow y_2(t)$, then for a linear system, $ax_1(t) + bx_2(t) \rightarrow ay_1(t) + by_2(t)$.

**Example:**
The slide provides an example to illustrate the superposition property in action. Given the system $y(t) = tx(t)$, it demonstrates how this system satisfies the superposition property, thus qualifying as a linear system.

- For $x_1(t) \rightarrow y_1(t) = tx_1(t)$
- For $x_2(t) \rightarrow y_2(t) = tx_2(t)$
- For $x_3(t) \rightarrow y_3(t) = tx_3(t)$

If $x_3(t) = ax_1(t) + bx_2(t)$, then using the given system:

$y_3(t) = t[ax_1(t) + bx_2(t)]$

$y_3(t) = atx_1(t) + btx_2(t)$

$y_3(t) = ay_1(t) + by_2(t)$

This shows that the superposition property holds for the system $y(t) = tx(t)$, confirming it as a linear system.

The slide is written on graph paper, suggesting a hand-written or hand-drawn format, likely from a classroom lecture. The content is detailed and includes mathematical equations and properties that are fundamental to understanding linear systems in the context of signal processing or control systems.

### Slide 4

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on system classification, focusing on the properties of linear and nonlinear systems. The slide is divided into two main examples that illustrate the behavior of these systems under scaling.

**Example 1: Nonlinear System**

*   **System Equation:** $y(t) = x^3(t)$
*   **Input-Output Pairs:**
    *   $x_1(t) \longrightarrow y_1(t) = x_1^3(t)$
    *   $x_2(t) \longrightarrow y_2(t) = x_2^3(t)$
*   **Scaling Property:**
    *   If $x_2(t) = Kx_1(t)$
    *   Then $y_2(t) = x_2^3(t) = K^3x_1^3(t) \neq Kx_1^3(t)$
*   **Conclusion:** $y_2(t) \neq Ky_1(t)$, indicating that scaling does not hold for this nonlinear system.

**Example 2: Nonlinear System**

*   **System Equation:** $y[n] = Re\{x[n]\}$
*   **Input-Output Pairs:**
    *   $x[n] = \delta[n] + j\omega[n]$
    *   $x_1[n] = \delta_1[n] + j\omega_1[n] \longrightarrow y_1[n] = \delta_1[n]$
    *   $x_2[n] = Kx_1[n] = jx_1[n] \longrightarrow x_2[n] = j\delta_1[n] - \omega_1[n]$
*   **Scaling Property:**
    *   $x_2[n] \longrightarrow y_2[n] = Re\{x_2[n]\} = -\omega_1[n]$
*   **Conclusion:** $y_2[n] \neq jy_1[n]$, indicating that scaling does not hold for this nonlinear system.

**Key Takeaway:**

*   The slide demonstrates that nonlinear systems do not satisfy the scaling property, which is a fundamental characteristic of linear systems.
*   The examples provided illustrate how nonlinear systems behave differently under scaling, highlighting their non-intuitive nature compared to linear systems.

**Additional Information:**

*   A photograph of a car's dashboard is displayed, featuring a speedometer and tachometer.

**Graphs and Plots**

*   Two hand-drawn graphs are presented:
    *   The top graph illustrates the relationship between pedal position $\theta(t)$ and time $t$. The graph shows a triangular input signal.
    *   The bottom graph depicts the relationship between pedal position $\theta(t)$ and time $\tau$. This graph displays a step input signal.
*   A plot of revolutions per minute (RPM) versus time $t$ is shown, featuring a red curve that represents the system's response to the input.

**Stability Analysis**

*   A green line on the plot indicates an unstable system, labeled as "BIBO unstable" (Bounded-Input Bounded-Output unstable).

**Additional Information**

*   The slide includes a notation "Week 3 Page 5" at the bottom left corner, suggesting that this is part of a larger lecture series.

Overall, this lecture slide provides a detailed explanation of the concepts of input, output, and stability in control systems, using a combination of visual aids, graphs, and mathematical representations to illustrate key ideas.

**Main Content**
The main content of the slide can be broken down into several sections:

*   **Linearity and Superposition**
    *   The slide starts by stating that an input signal $x(t)$ can be represented as the sum of simpler functions: $x(t) = \alpha_1 x_1(t) + \alpha_2 x_2(t) + \alpha_3 x_3(t) + ... + \alpha_m x_m(t)$
    *   Using linearity, the output $y(t)$ can be expressed as: $y(t) = \alpha_1 y_1(t) + \alpha_2 y_2(t) + \alpha_3 y_3(t) + ... + \alpha_m y_m(t)$
*   **Approximation and Impulse Response**
    *   A diagram shows a signal $x(t)$ approximated by rectangular pulses, with the approximation improving as $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$
    *   The signal can be described by time-shifted and scaled impulses
    *   If the system is time-invariant, then if we know the response of a system to an impulse (impulse response), we would know the response to any input
*   **LTI Systems and Impulse Response**
    *   In an LTI system, the impulse response enables system analysis
*   **Example**
    *   The impulse response of an LTI system is given by $h[n]$
    *   The input $x[n] = \delta[n]$ results in output $y[n] = h[n]$
    *   The input $x_1[n] = 2\delta[n]$ results in output $y_1[n] = 2h[n]$
    *   The input $x_2[n] = \delta[n-1]$ results in output $y_2[n] = h[n-1]$

**Diagrams and Graphs**

*   The use of linearity and superposition to analyze LTI systems
*   The approximation of signals using rectangular pulses and impulses
*   The relationship between the impulse response and the output of an LTI system

### Slide 7

The image presents a comprehensive visual representation of a lecture slide, focusing on the analysis of discrete-time signals and systems. The slide is divided into two main sections, each containing graphs and equations that illustrate key concepts in signal processing.

**Left Section:**

*   **Graph 1:** The first graph depicts a discrete-time signal $x_2[n] = \delta[n-1]$. This signal is represented by a single impulse at $n=1$, indicating that it has a value of 1 at $n=1$ and 0 elsewhere.
*   **Graph 2:** The second graph shows another discrete-time signal $x_1[n]$, which appears to be $2\delta[n]$. This signal has a value of 2 at $n=0$ and 0 elsewhere.

### Slide 10

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, focusing on the concept of convolution and its application to signals of long duration. The slide is divided into several sections, each addressing a specific aspect of LTI systems.

**Convolution Sum**

*   The top section of the slide introduces the convolution sum formula:

    $y[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[m]h[n-m] = x[n] * h[n]$

*   This equation represents the output $y[n]$ of an LTI system, where $x[n]$ is the input signal and $h[n]$ is the impulse response of the system.

**LTI System Response**

*   A diagram illustrates the process of an LTI system responding to an input signal $x[n]$ and producing an output signal $y[n]$ based on its impulse response $h[n]$.
*   The diagram shows that the input signal $x[n]$ is convolved with the impulse response $h[n]$ to produce the output $y[n]$.

**Method for LTI System Response to Signals of Long Duration**

*   The slide highlights a method for finding the output of an LTI system described by $h[n] = (\frac{3}{4})^n u[n]$ when the input signal is $x[n] = u[n]$.
*   The example involves calculating the output at specific time points, $n=-5$ and $n=5$.

**Graphical Representation**

*   Two graphs are provided to visualize the signals:
    *   The first graph shows $h[n]$ with a red vertical line at $n=0$ and smaller lines at $n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$, representing the impulse response of the system.
    *   The second graph depicts $h[n-m]$ as a function of $m$, with the x-axis labeled as $m$ and the y-axis as $h[n-m]$. This graph illustrates how the impulse response shifts as a function of $m$.

**Equations and Formulas**

*   The slide includes several equations and formulas related to LTI systems, including:
    *   $x[n]\delta[n-m] \rightarrow x[m]\delta[n-m]$
    *   $\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[m]\delta[n-m] = x[n]$
    *   $\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[m]h[n-m] = y[n]$

Overall, the slide provides a comprehensive overview of LTI systems, including the convolution sum, system response, and graphical representations of signals. The example worked out on the slide demonstrates how to apply these concepts to find the output of an LTI system with a given impulse response and input signal.
