# Exam Study Notes – Signals, Systems & Complex Numbers

---

## 1. Signals
- **Definition** – Any function that carries information.  
  $$x(t) \;\text{(continuous‑time)} \quad\text{or}\quad x[n] \;\text{(discrete‑time)}$$
- **Examples**  
  - Speech, vibration, ECG → $x(t)$  
  - Digital audio samples → $x[n]$  
- **Independent variable** – Usually time \(t\) or sample index \(n\).  
- **Notation** – $x(t)$ or $x[n]$; real or complex.

## 2. Systems
- **Definition** – Black box that receives an input signal \(x(\cdot)\) and produces an output \(y(\cdot)\).  
  $$y(t) = \mathcal{S}\{x(t)\}$$
- **Types** – Physical (mechanical, electrical), software algorithms, physiological, socio‑economic.

## 3. Signal Classifications

| Category | Definition | Key Property | Example |
|----------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Continuous‑time (C.T.)** | Defined for all \(t \in \mathbb{R}\) | Smooth or piecewise continuous | \(x(t)=\sin t\) |
| **Discrete‑time (D.T.)** | Defined only at integer indices \(n\) | Sequence of numbers | \(x[n]=(-1)^n\) |
| **Analog** | Dependent variable is continuous | Infinite levels | \(x(t)=e^{-t}\) |
| **Digital** | Dependent variable takes discrete values | Sampled or quantized | \(x[n]\in\{0,1\}\) |
| **Deterministic** | Predictable, can be written analytically | Known for all \(t\) | \(x(t)=t\) |
| **Stochastic (Random)** | Contains randomness, described by statistics | Probabilistic | Gaussian noise \(w(t)\) |
| **Causal** | \(x(t)=0\) for \(t<0\) | Depends only on present/past | Unit step \(u(t)\) |
| **Non‑causal** | Non‑zero for \(t<0\) | Requires future values | Anticausal impulse \(\delta(-t)\) |
| **Anticausal** | \(x(t)=0\) for \(t>0\) | Depends only on future | \(\delta(-t)\) |
| **Periodic** | \(x(t+T_0)=x(t)\) for some \(T_0>0\) | Repeats every period | \(x(t)=\sin(2\pi t/T_0)\) |
| **Aperiodic** | No finite period | Does not repeat | \(x(t)=e^{-t}\) |

*Remember*: Periodic signals must be defined for \(-\infty < t < \infty\).

## 4. Energy and Power

### Continuous‑time
- **Energy**  
  $$E_x = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(t)|^2\,dt$$
- **Power**  
  $$P_x = \lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}|x(t)|^2\,dt$$

### Discrete‑time
- **Energy**  
  $$E_x = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} |x[n]|^2$$
- **Power**  
  $$P_x = \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{2N+1}\sum_{n=-N}^{N} |x[n]|^2$$

### Classification
- **Energy signal** – Finite \(E_x < \infty\), zero average power.  
  (e.g., a finite‑duration pulse)
- **Power signal** – Finite non‑zero \(P_x\), infinite energy.  
  (e.g., a sinusoid)
- **Neither** – Infinite \(E_x\) and zero \(P_x\) (e.g., a decaying exponential).

> *Analogy*: Energy is the “total battery charge”; power is the “rate of discharge”.

## 5. Complex Numbers

| Form | Notation | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| Cartesian | \(z = a + jb\) | Real part \(a\), imaginary part \(b\) |
| Polar | \(z = re^{j\theta} = |z|e^{j\angle z}\) | Magnitude \(r=|z|\), angle \(\theta=\angle z\) |

- **Euler’s Formula**  
  $$e^{j\theta} = \cos\theta + j\sin\theta$$
- **Magnitude & Angle**  
  $$|z| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}, \qquad \angle z = \tan^{-1}\!\frac{b}{a}$$
- **Converting**  
  - Cartesian → Polar: compute \(r,\,\theta\).  
  - Polar → Cartesian: use Euler’s formula.

### Example: Convert a complex exponential signal to real form
$$x(t)=e^{j\pi t}+e^{-j\pi t} = 2\cos(\pi t)$$
(Apply Euler’s formula and combine the cosine terms.)

## 6. Solving \(z^4 = -1\)

- Write \(-1\) in exponential form:  
  \[
  -1 = e^{j(\pi + 2k\pi)}\quad(k\in\mathbb{Z})
  \]
- Take the fourth root:  
  \[
  z = e^{j\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + k\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \quad(k=0,1,2,3)
  \]
- **Unique solutions**  
  \[
  \boxed{
  \begin{aligned}
  z_0 &= e^{j\pi/4}      &&(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+j\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\\
  z_1 &= e^{j3\pi/4}     &&(-\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+j\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\\
  z_2 &= e^{j5\pi/4}     &&(-\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-j\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\\
  z_3 &= e^{j7\pi/4}     &&(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-j\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})
  \end{aligned}}
  \]

> *Visualization*: Place them at the 4th roots of unity on the unit circle, every \(90^\circ\).

The image presents a comprehensive lecture slide on the classification of signals, specifically focusing on continuous-time (C.T.) and discrete-time (D.T.) signals. The slide is divided into several sections, each providing detailed information and visual aids to facilitate understanding.

**Classification of Signals**

*   **Learning Outcome**: By the end of this section, students should be able to classify signals.
*   **Classification #1: Continuous Time vs. Discrete Time Signals**
    *   **C.T.**: If the signal is defined over a continuous range of time $x(t)$
        *   A graph illustrates a continuous-time signal with a wavy line plotted against time $t$ on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis.
    *   **D.T.**: Signal is specified at discrete instances (a sequence of numbers) $x[n]$
        *   A graph shows a discrete-time signal represented by vertical bars at specific time intervals, with the x-axis labeled as "Lecture number" and the y-axis labeled as "Number of students in lecture (D.T.)".

**Relationship Between C.T. and D.T. Signals**

*   A graph compares a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ and a discrete-time signal $x[n]$, illustrating how a D.T. signal can be generated by sampling a C.T. signal.
*   The relationship between C.T. and D.T. signals is described as: $x(t)$: C.T. Signal was sampled to generate $x[n]$: D.T. Signal

**Sampling of C.T. Signals**

*   A C.T. $x(t)$ sampled with sampling interval $T$

### Slide 5

The image presents a comprehensive overview of the classification of signals, specifically focusing on analog versus digital signals. The content is organized into several key points and visual aids to facilitate understanding.

*   **Classification #2: Analog vs Digital**
    *   The classification is based on two main categories: independent variable (time) and dependent variable.
    *   Independent variable (time):
        *   Continuous Time (C.T.)
        *   Discrete Time (D.T.)
    *   Dependent variable:
        *   Analog
        *   Digital

*   **Analog Signal**
    *   Definition: An analog signal has a dependent variable defined over a continuous range.
    *   Visual representation: A graph showing a continuous curve with a shaded area under it, indicating the continuous nature of the signal.

*   **Digital Signal**
    *   Definition: A digital signal is defined only on discrete values of the dependent variable.
    *   Visual representation: A graph showing a series of discrete points, illustrating the digital signal.

*   **Deterministic Data**
    *   A graph showing a waveform with a clear, repeating pattern.
    *   The waveform has an amplitude range of approximately -2 to 2.
    *   The x-axis represents time, ranging from 0 to 25.

*   **Random Data**
    *   A graph showing a waveform with a random, noise-like pattern.
    *   The waveform has an amplitude range of approximately -2 to 2.
    *   The x-axis represents time, ranging from 0 to 25.

*   **Discrete-Time Signal**
    *   A graph showing a series of discrete points, representing a discrete-time signal.
    *   The y-axis represents the amplitude, ranging from 80 to 100.
    *   The x-axis represents the lecture number, ranging from 1 to 7.

In summary, the image provides a detailed explanation of the classification of signals into analog and digital types, along with visual representations to illustrate the differences between these categories. The use of graphs and diagrams helps to clarify the concepts of continuous and discrete signals, as well as deterministic and random data.

### Slide 6

The image presents a comprehensive overview of signal classification, focusing on deterministic versus stochastic signals, causal, noncausal, and anticusal signals, as well as periodic and aperiodic signals. The content is structured into sections, each addressing a specific classification criterion.

**Classification #3: Deterministic vs Stochastic (Random) Signal**

*   **Definition:**
    *   Deterministic signals are predictable (e.g., can be described by functions).
    *   Random or stochastic signals are not predictable.
*   **Graphical Representation:**
    *   Two graphs are provided:
        *   The top graph illustrates deterministic data, showcasing a predictable pattern.
        *   The bottom graph represents random data, displaying an unpredictable pattern.

**Classification #4: Causal, Noncausal, and Anticusal Signals**

*   **Definitions:**
    *   **Causal:** $x(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$
    *   **Noncausal:** Starts before time $0$ ($t=0$), $x(t) \neq 0$ for $t < 0$
    *   **Anticusal:** $x(t) = 0$ for $t > 0$
*   **Graphical Representation:**
    *   Three graphs illustrate the characteristics of causal, noncausal, and anticusal signals.
    *   A note clarifies that an everlasting signal is noncausal but not all noncausal signals are everlasting.

**Classification #5: Periodic vs. Aperiodic Signals**

*   **Definition:**
    *   A signal $x(t)$ is periodic if for some positive constant $T_0$, $x(t+T_0) = x(t)$.
    *   The smallest $T_0$ is called the fundamental period of the signal.
*   **Mathematical Representation:**
    *   $x(t) = x(t+2T_0) = x(t+3T_0) = ...$
*   **Graphical Representation:**
    *   A graph depicts a periodic signal with labeled periods ($T_0$).
*   **Note:**
    *   A periodic signal should run from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ in time.

In summary, the image provides a detailed classification of signals based on their predictability, causality, and periodicity, accompanied by graphical representations and mathematical definitions to facilitate understanding.

### Slide 7

The image presents a comprehensive lecture slide on signal energy and power signals in the context of continuous time (C.T.) and discrete time (D.T.) systems. The slide is divided into two main sections, with the left side focusing on C.T. and the right side on D.T.

**Notes at the Top**

* A note is provided to clarify that a periodic signal should run from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ in time.
* A second note explains that for $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, the integral of a signal $x(t)$ over a period $T_0$ is equal to the integral over any other interval of the same length, i.e., $\int_{a}^{a+T_0} x(t)dt = \int_{b}^{b+T_0} x(\tau) d\tau = \int_{0}^{T_0} x(t)dt$. This allows for the integration to be written over one period.

**Classification #6: Energy and Power Signal**

### Continuous Time (C.T.)

* **Signal Energy**: A measure for the size of a signal (Section 1.1-1)
	+ $E_x = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(t)|^2 dt$
	+ $x(t)$ is generally a complex signal: $x(t) = a(t) + jb(t)$
	+ $|x(t)| = \sqrt{a^2(t) + b^2(t)}$
	+ If $x(t)$ is real-valued, then $|x(t)|^2 = x^2(t)$
	+ $E_x = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2(t) dt$ for real signals
	+ $E_x$ exists if $|x(t)| \rightarrow 0$ as $|t| \rightarrow \infty$
* **Energy Signal**: A signal with finite energy
	+ Finite energy: $E_x < \infty$
	+ Infinite energy: $E_x$ doesn't exist (NOT an energy signal)
* **Signal Power**
	+ $P_x = \lim_{T \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} |x(t)|^2 dt$
	+ If $x(t)$ is real-valued, then $|x(t)|^2 = x^2(t)$
	+ For a real-valued signal: $P_x = \lim_{T \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x^2(t) dt$

### Discrete Time (D.T.)

* **Section 3.1**
	+ $E_x = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} |x[n]|^2$
	+ $E_x$ exists if $|x[n]| \rightarrow 0$ as $|n| \rightarrow \infty$
* **Example**
	+ $E_x = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x^2[n]$
	+ $E_x = \sum_{n=1}^{2} x^2[n] = 1+2+3 = 1+4+9 = 14$
* **Signal Power**
	+ $P_x = \lim_{T \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} |x[n]|^2$
	+ $P_x = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2N+1} \sum_{n=-N}^{N} |x[n]|^2$

The slide provides a detailed explanation of energy and power signals in both continuous and discrete time systems, including definitions, formulas, and examples.

### Slide 8

The image presents a detailed lecture slide on signal classification, focusing on power and energy signals. The content is organized into sections, each addressing specific aspects of signal analysis.

**Equations and Formulas:**

*   **Power Signal Definition:** $P_x = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x^2(t) dt$
*   **Alternative Expression for Power Signal:** $P_x = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x^2(t) dt$ (for periodic signals)
*   **Example 1:** For $x(t) = t, -1 < t < 1$, and $P_x = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} t^2 dt = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^{1} t^2 dt = \frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{t^3}{3}\right]_{-1}^{1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{-1}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{3}$
*   **Example 2:** For a discrete-time signal, $P_x = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{2N+1} \sum_{n=-N}^{N} |x[n]|^2 = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{n=0}^{3} |x[n]|^2 = \frac{1}{4}(0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{14}{4} = \frac{7}{8}$

**Definitions:**

*   **Power Signal:** A signal with non-zero finite power.
*   **Energy Signal:** A signal with finite energy.

**Notes:**

1.  **Power and Energy Relationship:** Power is the time average of energy. Because time averaging is over an infinite range of time, an energy signal has zero power.
2.  **Signal Classification:** 
    *   A signal with finite power has infinite energy.
    *   A signal cannot be both an energy and a power signal.
3.  **Signal Categories:** A signal can be neither energy nor power signal.
4.  **RMS Value of a Signal:** The rms value of a signal is $\sqrt{P_x}$.

**Diagrams and Images:**

*   **Example 1 Diagram:** A graph showing a periodic sawtooth wave with amplitude 1 and period 2.
*   **Example 2 Diagram:** A graph showing a discrete-time signal with values 0, 1, 2, and 3 at different time intervals.

**Key Points:**

*   The slide provides a comprehensive overview of power and energy signals, including their definitions, properties, and examples.
*   It highlights the differences between power and energy signals, emphasizing that a signal cannot be both.
*   The rms value of a signal is defined as the square root of its power.

### Slide 9

The image presents a comprehensive tutorial on complex numbers, covering various aspects of the topic. The tutorial is divided into sections, each focusing on a specific area of complex numbers.

**Quick Review**

*   The tutorial begins with a quick review of complex numbers, introducing the concept of a complex number $z$ as:
    *   $z = a + jb = re^{j\theta} = |z|e^{j\angle z}$
    *   where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, $j$ is the imaginary unit, $r$ is the magnitude, $\theta$ is the angle, and $|z|$ is the modulus.
*   Euler's formula is also presented:
    *   $e^{j\theta} = \cos \theta + j\sin \theta$

**Example: Express the following complex numbers in cartesian form**

*   The tutorial provides three examples:
    *   A) $z_a = j + e^{j\frac{3\pi}{4}}$
        *   $z_a = j + e^{j\frac{3\pi}{4}} = j + \cos(\frac{3\pi}{4}) + j\sin(\frac{3\pi}{4})$
        *   $z_a = j + (-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) + j(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$
    *   B) $z_b = 3e^{j\frac{3\pi}{4}}$
        *   $z_b = 3(\cos(\frac{3\pi}{4}) + j\sin(\frac{3\pi}{4}))$
        *   $z_b = 3(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) + j3(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$
    *   C) $z_c = \frac{1}{e^{j\pi}}$
        *   $z_c = e^{-j\pi} = \cos(-\pi) + j\sin(-\pi) = -1$

**Other Option: Plot in Complex Plane**

*   The tutorial also provides an alternative approach to representing complex numbers in the complex plane.
*   A diagram shows the complex plane with real and imaginary axes labeled.
*   The complex number $z_b = 3e^{j\frac{3\pi}{4}}$ is plotted in the complex plane, with its real and imaginary parts labeled.

**Example 2: Express the following complex exponential signal in purely real form**

*   The tutorial presents an example of expressing a complex exponential signal in purely real form:
    *   $x(t) = e^{j\pi t} + e^{-j\pi t}$
    *   Using Euler's formula, we get:
        *   $x(t) = \cos(\pi t) + j\sin(\pi t) + \cos(-\pi t) + j\sin(-\pi t)$
        *   $x(t) = 2\cos(\pi t)$

In summary, the tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of complex numbers, covering their representation in cartesian form, polar form, and the complex plane. It also demonstrates how to express complex exponential signals in purely real form using Euler's formula.

### Slide 10

The image presents a detailed lecture slide focused on solving the equation $z^4 = -1$. The content is organized into several sections, each addressing a specific aspect of the problem.

**Problem Statement and Initial Analysis**

* The equation to solve is $z^4 = -1$.
* It is noted that $z$ must be complex.

**Euler's Identity and Its Application**

* Euler's Identity is highlighted: $e^{i\pi} = -1$.
* A note clarifies that $e^{i\pi}$ is not unique; other $e^{i\theta}$ values can also equal $-1$, such as $e^{i3\pi} = e^{i\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1$.
* Generally, $-1 = e^{i(\pi + k2\pi)}$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ (integer).

**Solving for $z$**

* The goal is to solve for $z$ in $z^4 = -1$.
* Using the general form of $-1$, we have $z^4 = e^{i(\pi + k \cdot 2\pi)}$.
* Taking the fourth root of both sides yields $z = (e^{i(\pi + k \cdot 2\pi)})^{1/4} = e^{i(\pi/4 + k\pi/2)}$ for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

**Approach: Plotting on the Complex Plane**

* The approach involves plotting on the complex plane for different values of $k$ to find 4 unique vectors.
* A diagram shows the complex plane with the real axis (Re) on the x-axis and the imaginary axis (Im) on the y-axis.
* Four vectors are plotted:
	+ For $k=0$: $e^{i(\pi/4 + 0 \cdot \pi/2)} = e^{i\pi/4}$.
	+ For $k=1$: $e^{i(\pi/4 + 1 \cdot \pi/2)} = e^{i3\pi/4}$.
	+ For $k=2$: $e^{i(\pi/4 + 2 \cdot \pi/2)} = e^{i5\pi/4}$.
	+ For $k=3$: $e^{i(\pi/4 + 3 \cdot \pi/2)} = e^{i7\pi/4}$.
* It is noted that increasing $k$ will result in vectors overlapping with one of the first four plotted.

**Unique Solutions**

* The unique solutions are identified as $z = e^{i\pi/4}, e^{i3\pi/4}, e^{i5\pi/4}, e^{i7\pi/4}$.

In summary, the lecture slide provides a step-by-step solution to the equation $z^4 = -1$, utilizing Euler's Identity and plotting on the complex plane to find the four unique solutions.
